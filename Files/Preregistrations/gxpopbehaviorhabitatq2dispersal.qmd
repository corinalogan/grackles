### ABSTRACT

It is generally thought that behavioral flexibility, the ability to change behavior when circumstances change, plays an important role in the ability of a species to rapidly expand their geographic range [e.g. @lefebvre1997feeding; @griffin2014innovation; @chow2016practice; @sol2000behavioural; @sol2002behavioural; @sol2005big; @sol2007big]. However, it is an alternative non-exclusive possibility that an increase in the amount of available habitat can also facilitate a range expansion [@hanski1991metapopulation; @wiens1997metapopulation]. Great-tailed grackles (*Quiscalus mexicanus*) are a social, polygamous species that is rapidly expanding its geographic range [@wehtje2003range] and eats a variety of human foods in addition to foraging on insects and on the ground for other natural food items [@johnson2001great]. They are behaviorally flexible [@logan2016flexibilityproblem] and highly associated with human-modified environments [@johnson2001great], thus offering an opportunity to assess the role of behavior and habitat change over the course of their expansion. We first aim to compare behavior in wild-caught grackles from three populations across their range (core of the original range, a more recent population in the middle of the northern expansion front, a very recent population on the northern edge of the expansion front) to investigate whether: 1) certain behaviors (flexibility, innovativeness, exploration, and persistence) have higher averages and variances in some populations relative to others, and 2) individuals in a more recently established population exhibit more dispersal behavior (i.e., individuals are more likely to move away from their parents). Secondly, we aim to investigate whether habitat availability, not necessarily inherent species differences, can explain why great-tailed grackles are able to much more rapidly expand their range than their closest relative, boat-tailed grackles (*Q. major*) [@post1996boat; @wehtje2003range]. We will examine temporal habitat changes over the past few decades using existing databases on presence/absence of both grackle species and compare habitat variables to determine whether: 3) these species use different habitats, habitat suitability and connectivity (which combined determines whether habitat is available) has increased across their range, and what proportion of suitable habitat both species occupy. **Finally, we will 4) determine whether changes in behavioral traits facilitate the rapid GTGR expansion by comparing their behavior with BTGR on the same tests in aim 1.** Results will elucidate whether the rapid geographic range expansion of great-tailed grackles is associated with individuals differentially expressing particular behaviors and/or whether the expansion is facilitated by the alignment of their natural behaviors with an increase in suitable habitat (i.e., human-modified environments).

### INTRODUCTION

It is generally thought that behavioral flexibility, the ability to change behavior when circumstances change [see @mikhalevich_is_2017 for theoretical background on our flexibility definition], plays an important role in the ability of a species to rapidly expand their geographic range [e.g., @lefebvre1997feeding; @griffin2014innovation; @chow2016practice; @sol2000behavioural; @sol2002behavioural; @sol2005big; @sol2007big]. These ideas predict that flexibility, exploration, and innovation facilitate the expansion of individuals into completely new areas and that their role diminishes after a certain number of generations [@wright2010behavioral]. In support of this, experimental studies have shown that latent abilities are primarily expressed in a time of need [e.g., @taylor2007spontaneous; @bird2009insightful; @manrique2011spontaneous; @auersperg2012spontaneous; @laumer2018spontaneous]. Therefore, we do not expect the founding individuals who initially dispersed out of their original range to have unique behavioral characteristics that are passed on to their offspring. Instead, we expect that the actual act of continuing a range expansion relies on flexibility, exploration, innovation, and persistence, and that these behaviors are therefore expressed more on the edge of the expansion range where there have not been many generations to accumulate relevant knowledge about the environment.

To determine whether behavior is involved in a rapid geographic range expansion, direct measures of individual behavioral abilities must be collected in populations across the range of the species [see the discussion on the danger of proxies of flexibility in @logan2018beyond]. We plan to test whether behavioral flexibility and/or an increase in habitat availability play a role in the rapid geographic range expansion of great-tailed grackles (*Quiscalus mexicanus*). Great-tailed grackles are behaviorally flexible [@logan2016flexibilityproblem], rapidly expanding their geographic range [@wehtje2003range], and highly associated with human-modified environments [@johnson2001great], thus offering an opportunity to assess the role of behavior and habitat change over the course of their expansion. This social, polygamous species eats a variety of human foods in addition to foraging on insects and on the ground for other natural food items [@johnson2001great]. This feature increases the ecological relevance of comparative cognition experiments that measure individual behavior abilities: grackles eat at outdoor cafes, from garbage cans, and they eat our crops. As such, they generally gain experience in the wild with approaching and opening novel objects to seek food (e.g., attempting to open a ketchup packet at an outdoor cafe, climbing into garbage cans to get french fries at the zoo, dunking sugar packets in water), which makes the tests involving human-made apparatuses ecologically relevant for this species.

We here compare behavior in wild-caught great-tailed grackles from two populations across their range (a more recent population in the middle of the northern expansion front: Arizona, a very recent population on the northern edge of the expansion front: California). We investigated whether certain behaviors have higher averages and variances in the edge population relative to older populations. Specifically, in this article, we examine whether individuals in a recently established population (California) are more likely to move away from the location they hatched by determining whether their average relatedness (calculated using single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) is lower than what we would expect if individuals move randomly [@sevchik2019dispersal].

There could be multiple mechanisms underpinning the results we find, however our aim is to narrow down the role of changes in behavior and changes in habitats in the range expansion of great-tailed grackles. Results will elucidate whether the rapid geographic range expansion of great-tailed grackles is associated with individuals differentially expressing particular behaviors and/or whether the expansion is facilitated by the alignment of their natural behaviors with an increase in suitable habitat (i.e., human-modified environments).

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS


#### Q2 (dispersal behavior: great-tailed grackles): Are there differences in dispersal behavior across the great-tailed grackle's geographic range? (Fig. 1, Table 1)

**Prediction 2:** We predict **more dispersal at the edge**: a higher proportion of individuals, particularly females, which is the sex that appears to be philopatric in the middle of the range expansion [@sevchik2019dispersal], disperse in a more recently established population and, accordingly, fewer individuals are closely related to each other. *This would support the hypothesis* that changes in dispersal behavior are involved in the great-tailed grackle's geographic range expansion.

**Prediction 2 alternative 1:** We predict that the **proportion of individuals dispersing is not related to when the population established** at a particular site and, accordingly, the average relatedness is similar across populations. *This supports the hypothesis* that the original dispersal behavior was already well adapted in this species to facilitate a range expansion.

**Table 1.** Population characteristics for each of the three field sites in Q1 and Q2. The number of generations at a site is based on a generation length of 5.6 years for this species [@GTGRbirdlife2018; note that this species starts breeding at age 1], and on the first year in which this species was reported (or estimated) to breed at each location (Woodland, California: Yolo Audubon Society's newsletter *The Burrowing Owl* (July 2004), which Steve Hampton shared with Logan; Tempe, Arizona: estimated based on 1945 first-sighting report in nearby Phoenix, Arizona [@wehtje2004thesis] to which we added 6 years, which is the average time between first-sighting and first-breeding - see Table 3 in [@wehtje2003range]; Central America: there is no data on the first year in which they started breeding because this species originates in this region, therefore we used the age of the species: 800,000 years [@johnsoncicero2004new]).

### STATE OF THE DATA AND CHANGES FROM PREREGISTRATION

The preregistration was written (Mar 2020) prior to collecting any data from the edge and core populations, therefore we were blind to these data. However, we were not blind to some of the data from the Arizona population: some of the relatedness data (SNPs used for Hypothesis 2 to quantify relatedness to infer whether individuals disperse away from relatives) from the middle population (Arizona) has already been analyzed for other purposes (n=57 individuals, [see](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gdispersal_manuscript.html) @sevchik2019dispersal). Therefore, it will be considered secondary data: data that are in the process of being collected for other investigations. We have now collected blood samples from many more grackles in Arizona, therefore we will redo the analyses from the Arizona population in the analyses involved in the current preregistration. In May 2020, we completed data collection for other variables at the Arizona field site: [flexibility and innovation](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexmanip.html) [@logan2019flexmanip], and [exploration](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_exploration.html) [@mccune2019exploration], and we will soon analyze this data, therefore it will also be considered secondary data. This preregistration was submitted in May 2020 to PCI Ecology for pre-study peer review. We received the reviews, and revised and resubmitted in Aug 2020, and it passed pre-study peer review in Oct 2020.

**Level of data blindness:** Logan and McCune collect the behavioral data (Q1) and therefore have seen this data for the Arizona population. Lukas has access to the Arizona data and has seen some of the summaries in presentations. Chen has not seen any data.

- Due to various reasons, we did not collect data for the third population from the core of the original distribution.

### METHODS

####  Sample

**Q2:** Great-tailed grackles were caught in the wild in Woodland and Sacramento, California. Adults were identified from their eye color, which changes from brown to yellow upon reaching adulthood (Johnson and Peer 2001). We applied colored leg bands in unique combinations for individual identification. Some individuals (\~20) were brought temporarily into aviaries for behavioral choice tests, and then were released back to the wild at their point of capture. We caught grackles with a variety of methods (e.g., walk-in traps, mist nets, bow nets), some of which decrease the likelihood of a selection bias for exploratory and bold individuals because grackles cannot see the traps (i.e., mist nets). 

While the above is our ideal plan, due to restrictions around COVID-19, it may not be possible for us to accomplish all of our goals within our current funding period. We think it will be possible to collect data at one more site (which would be the second of three planned sites) and we will attempt to also include a third field site.


#### Sample size rationale


**Q2:** We test as many great-tailed grackles as we can during the approximately one year we spend at each site given that the birds are only brought into the aviaries during the non-breeding season (approximately September through March). It is time intensive to conduct the aviary test battery (2-6 months per bird at the Arizona field site), therefore we approximate that the minimum sample size at each site will follow the minimum sample sizes in Table 2 with the aim that half of the grackles tested at each site are female. However, we expect to be able to test 20 grackles per site.


#### Data collection stopping rule

We will stop collecting data on wild-caught great-tailed grackles in Q1 and Q2 (data for Q3 are collected from the literature) once we have completed one year at each of the California and Central America sites (likely complete in summer 2022), which coincides with the period in which we currently have funding (until early 2023). If we are not able to collect data at a third site, we will attempt to collect more data during a second year at the second site (Woodland, CA).

#### Protocols and open materials

-   **Dispersal:** DNA is collected from the grackles, processed, and analyzed for pairwise relatedness using ddRADseq and Stacks as in @sevchik2019dispersal ([protocol](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gdispersal_manuscript.html)).


#### Open data

All data for analyses are available in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity's data repository. Raw genotype files are available in the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information.

#### Blinding during analysis

Blinding is usually not involved in the final analyses because the experimenters collect the data (and therefore have seen some form of it) and run the analyses. 

### E. ANALYSIS PLAN

We use **simulations** and design customized **models** to determine what sample sizes allow us to detect differences between sites (see chapter 5.3 in @bolker2008ecological for why simulations perform more powerful power analyses). We do not plan to **exclude** any data and if there are **missing** data (e.g. if a bird participated in one of the two experiments, then it will only be included in those analyses for which it has data). Analyses will be conducted in R (current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam) and Stan (version 2.18, @carpenter2017stan).


#### Q2: dispersal

*Response variable*

1)  Average relatedness between all pairs of individuals within one sex

*Explanatory variables*

1)  Site diameter (meters)

2)  Site sample size

3)  Number of generations at a site

One model will be run per sex

The data will be analyzed as in @sevchik2019dispersal. To summarize, blood is collected from the bird, DNA is extracted (by Aaron Blackwell at Washington State University), size selected (between 400-700 base pairs), and sequenced using ddRADseq (at Cornell University Lab of Ornithology) on an Illumina NextSeq500 machine using the mid-output setting for 150 base pair single end reads. Data are post processed to generate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as in @thrasher2018double. Genetic relatedness between all pairs of individuals is calculated using the package “related” (@pew2015related) in R (as in @thrasher2018double) using the estimator by Queller & Goodnight, which was more robust for our inferences in a subset of the Arizona data [@sevchik2019dispersal]. Permutations (i.e., randomly assigning site ID to individuals) and general linear models estimating average relatedness of each individual to all others at that site will be used to determine whether individuals at one site are more closely related to each other than the individuals at another site.

**Model and simulation**

Expected values for average relatedness per bird were based on the fact that average relatedness with these estimators has to range between -1 and 1 and because it is an average we expect a normal distribution.
