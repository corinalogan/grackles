## ABSTRACT

## INTRODUCTION

We focused our study on great-tailed grackles (*Quiscalus mexicanus*, hereafter grackles), a bird species that is flexible [@logan2016behavioral] and rapidly expanding its geographic range [@wehtje2003range]. We attempted to manipulate grackle flexibility using serial reversals of a color preference to determine whether their flexibility is generalizable across additional experimental contexts (touchscreen reversal learning and multi-access box solution switching), whether improving flexibility also improves innovativeness (number of loci solved on a multi-access box), whether it is repeatable within individuals and across contexts, and what learning strategies grackles employ (Figure 1). 


**Figure 1.** A visual illustration of Hypothesis 1 (A), Hypothesis 2 (B), Hypothesis 3 (C1 and C2), and Hypothesis 4 (D). Longer black arrows indicate slower reversal times, the two yellow circles represent experience with the two yellow tubes that both contained food for the control group.


## HYPOTHESES

#### H3a: Behavioral flexibility within a context is repeatable within individuals.

Repeatability of behavioral flexibility is defined as the number of trials to reverse a color preference being strongly negatively correlated within individuals with the number of reversals.

**P3a:** Individuals that are faster to reverse a color preference in the first reversal will also be faster to reverse a color preference in the second, etc. reversal due to natural individual variation.

**P3a alternative:** There is no repeatability in behavioral flexibility within individuals, which could indicate that performance is state dependent (e.g., it depends on their fluctuating motivation, hunger levels, etc.). We will determine whether performance on colored tube reversal learning related to motivation by examining whether the latency to make a choice influenced the results. We will also determine whether performance was related to hunger levels by examining whether the number of minutes since the removal of their maintenance diet from their aviary plus the number of food rewards they received since then influenced the results.

#### H3b: The consistency of behavioral flexibility in individuals across contexts (context 1=reversal learning on colored tubes, context 2=multi-access boxes, context 3=reversal learning on touchscreen) indicates their ability to generalize across contexts.

Individual consistency of behavioral flexibility is defined as the number of trials to reverse a color preference being strongly positively correlated within individuals with the latency to solve new loci on each of the multi-access boxes and with the number of trials to reverse a color preference on a touchscreen (total number of touchscreen reversals = 5 per bird).

*If P3a is supported (repeatability of flexibility within individuals)...*

**P3b:** ...and flexibility is correlated across contexts, then the more flexible individuals are better at generalizing across contexts.

**P3b alternative 1:** ...and flexibility is not correlated across contexts, then there is something that influences an individual's ability to discount cues in a given context. This could be the individual's reinforcement history (tested in P3a alternative), their reliance on particular learning strategies (one alternative is tested in H4), or their motivation (tested in P3a alternative) to engage with a particular task (e.g., difficulty level of the task). 

### DEVIATIONS FROM THE PREREGISTRATION

**Post data collection, mid-data analysis**

6) The distribution of values for the "number of trials to reverse" response variable in the [P3a analysis](#p3a-repeatable-within-individuals-within-a-context-reversal-learning) was not a good fit for the Poisson distribution because it was overdispersed and heteroscedastic. We **log-transformed** the data to approximate a normal distribution and it passed all of the data checks. Therefore, we used a Gaussian distribution for our model, which fits the log-transformed data well. (24 Aug 2021).

## RESULTS

Data are publicly [available](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1862DWC) at the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity [@logan2021flexmanipdata].

Performance was repeatable within individuals within the context of reversal learning. We obtained a repeatability value of 0.13, which is significantly greater than that expected if birds are performing randomly in each reversal (p=0.001; see analysis details in the R code for Analysis Plan > P3a). Consequently, and as preregistered, we did not need to conduct the analysis for the P3a alternative to determine whether a lack of repeatability was due to motivation or hunger.

### P3b: repeatable across contexts



```{r consistent2results, eval=T}
## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS: We realized that to determine whether individuals that are faster to reverse a color preference also have lower latencies to switch to new options on the multi-access box, we needed the variables on the same measurement scale (seconds). The serial reversal learning latencies to switch a preference were previously at the trial-level measurement scale. However, all trials had start times so we were able to calculate the latency to switch a preference in seconds, across trials. For the repeatability analysis we were then able to create a data frame that consisted of latency to switch (labeled as duration of time to switch in data frame), Condition (test type - Reversal, MAB plastic, MAB wooden), reversal number (i.e. only serial reversal or locus solves after initial color tube discrimination/first MAB solve), and bird ID.
### DEVIATION: We also realize we incorrectly specified the variables that would be included in the repeatability model in the preregistration. The DV is the latency to switch a preference after the previously rewarded preference becomes non-functional. The IVs are Test type, Reversal Number and a random effect for Bird ID.

#n=16 birds participated in at least one switch (reversal) across at least 2 tests (reversal learning and/or MAB plastic and/or MAB wooden)

#NOTE: removed "touchscreen trials to reverse" from the models below because the touchscreen experiment did not end up working out.

## DISCUSSION

Examining only the manipulated grackles, there was **repeatability of flexibility performance within a context (serial reversal learning with colored tubes), but not across contexts (correlation of reversal learning and solution switching on the multi-access boxes)**. Individuals who were faster at reversing a color preference in reversal 1 were also generally faster at reversing in subsequent reversals.



### D. PREREGISTRATION (detailed methods) 
#### **Dependent variables**

*P3a and P3a alternative 1*

Number of trials to reverse a preference. An individual is considered to have a preference if it chose the rewarded option at least 17 out of the most recent 20 trials (with a minimum of 8 or 9 correct choices out of 10 on the two most recent sets of 10 trials). We use a sliding window to look at the most recent 10 trials for a bird, regardless of when the testing sessions occurred.


*P3b: additional analysis: individual consistency in flexibility across contexts + flexibility is correlated across contexts*

Number of trials to solve a new locus on the multi-access boxes *NOTE: Jul 2022 we realized this variable is more likely to represent innovation, and we mean to assess flexibility here. Therefore we changed this variable to Latency to Switch a preference after the previously rewarded color/loci becomes non-functional.*

#### **Independent variables**

#### *P3a: repeatable within individuals within a context*

1) Reversal number

2) ID (random effect because repeated measures on the same individuals)

#### *P3a alternative 1: was the potential lack of repeatability on colored tube reversal learning due to motivation or hunger?*

1) Trial number

2) Latency from the beginning of the trial to when they make a choice

3) Minutes since maintenance diet was removed from the aviary

4) Cumulative number of rewards from previous trials on that day

5) ID (random effect because repeated measures on the same individuals)

6) Batch (random effect because repeated measures on the same individuals). Note: batch is a test cohort, consisting of 8 birds being tested simultaneously

#### *P3b: repeatable across contexts*

*NOTE: Jul 2022 we changed the dependent variable such that it is now the same as IVs 3 & 4, below. Furthermore, we did not include the touchscreen experiment in this manuscript (see the Deviations section). Therefore we deleted these IVs from the model.*
1) Reversal number

2) Condition (colored tubes, plastic multi-access box, wooden multi-access box, touchscreen)

3) Latency to solve a new locus

4) Number of trials to reverse a preference (colored tubes)

5) Number of trials to reverse a preference (touchscreen)

6) ID (random effect because repeated measures on the same individuals)


### E. ANALYSIS PLAN

#### *P3a: repeatable within individuals within a context (reversal learning)*

**Analysis:** Is reversal learning (colored tubes) repeatable within individuals within a context (reversal learning)? We will obtain repeatability estimates that account for the observed and latent scales, and then compare them with the raw repeatability estimate from the null model. The repeatability estimate indicates how much of the total variance, after accounting for fixed and random effects, is explained by individual differences (ID). We will run this GLMM using the MCMCglmm function in the MCMCglmm package [@hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage] with a Poisson distribution and log link using 13,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 10, a burnin of 3,000, and minimal priors [V=1, nu=0; @hadfield2014coursenotes]. We will ensure the GLMM shows acceptable convergence [i.e., lag time autocorrelation values <0.01; @hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage], and adjust parameters if necessary.

NOTE (Aug 2021): our data checking process showed that the distribution of values of the data (number of trials to reverse) in this model was not a good fit for the Poisson distribution because it was overdispersed and heteroscedastic. However, when log-transformed the data approximate a normal distribution and pass all of the data checks, therefore we used a Gaussian distribution for our model, which fits the log-transformed data well.

To roughly estimate our ability to detect actual effects (because these power analyses are designed for frequentist statistics, not Bayesian statistics), we ran a power analysis in G&ast;Power with the following settings: test family=F tests, statistical test=linear multiple regression: Fixed model (R^2 deviation from zero), type of power analysis=a priori, alpha error probability=0.05. The number of predictor variables was restricted to only the fixed effects because this test was not designed for mixed models. We reduced the power to 0.70 and increased the effect size until the total sample size in the output matched our projected sample size (n=32). The protocol of the power analysis is here:

*Input:*

Effect size f¬≤                	=	0.21

Œ± err prob                    	=	0.05

Power (1-Œ≤ err prob)          	=	0.7

# DATA CHECKING
# ADDED Aug 2021 - Although our dependent variable (number of trials to reverse) is a count variable, the distribution of values was not appropriate for a poisson regression.  When checking the fit of our data to a Poisson model the data were overdispersed and heteroscedastic.  However, when log-transformed the data approximate a normal distribution and pass all of the below data checks, indicating the Gaussian model fits our log-transformed data well.

# ADDED Aug 2021
#Is 0.13 a statistically significant repeatability? Test whether it is significantly greater than expected at chance by permuting number of trials to reverse among individuals.
#NOTE: Because the flexibility manipulation requires the last two reversals to be less than or equal to 50 trials, and ReverseNumber is significant, indicating birds generally get faster over time, we must permute TrialsToReverse across birds within ReverseNumber.

#### *P3a alternative: was the potential lack of repeatability on colored tube reversal learning due to motivation or hunger?*

**Analysis:** Because the independent variables could influence each other or measure the same variable, I will analyze them in a single model: Generalized Linear Mixed Model [GLMM; MCMCglmm function, MCMCglmm package; @hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage] with a binomial distribution (called categorical in MCMCglmm) and logit link using 13,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 10, a burnin of 3,000, and minimal priors (V=1, nu=0) [@hadfield2014coursenotes]. We will ensure the GLMM shows acceptable convergence [lag time autocorrelation values <0.01; @hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage], and adjust parameters if necessary. The contribution of each independent variable will be evaluated using the Estimate in the full model. NOTE (Apr 2021): This analysis is restricted to data from their first reversal because this is the only reversal data that is comparable across the manipulated and control groups.

To roughly estimate our ability to detect actual effects (because these power analyses are designed for frequentist statistics, not Bayesian statistics), we ran a power analysis in G&ast;Power with the following settings: test family=F tests, statistical test=linear multiple regression: Fixed model (R^2 deviation from zero), type of power analysis=a priori, alpha error probability=0.05. We reduced the power to 0.70 and increased the effect size until the total sample size in the output matched our projected sample size (n=32). The number of predictor variables was restricted to only the fixed effects because this test was not designed for mixed models. The protocol of the power analysis is here:

*Input:*

Effect size f¬≤                	=	0.31

Œ± err prob                    	=	0.05

Power (1-Œ≤ err prob)          	=	0.7

Number of predictors          	=	4

*Output:*

Noncentrality parameter Œª     	=	11.4700000

Critical F                    	=	2.6684369

Numerator df                  	=	4

Denominator df                	=	32

Total sample size             	=	37

Actual power                  	=	0.7113216

This means that, with our sample size of 32, we have a 71% chance of detecting a large effect [approximated at f^2^=0.35 by @cohen1988statistical].

#### *P3b: individual consistency across contexts*

**Analysis:** Do those individuals that are faster to reverse a color preference also have lower latencies to switch to new options on the multi-access box? A Generalized Linear Mixed Model [GLMM; MCMCglmm function, MCMCglmm package; [@hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage] will be used with a Poisson distribution and log link using 13,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 10, a burnin of 3,000, and minimal priors (V=1, nu=0) [@hadfield2014coursenotes]. We will ensure the GLMM shows acceptable convergence [lag time autocorrelation values <0.01; @hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage], and adjust parameters if necessary. We will determine whether an independent variable had an effect or not using the Estimate in the full model.

To roughly estimate our ability to detect actual effects (because these power analyses are designed for frequentist statistics, not Bayesian statistics), we ran a power analysis in G\*Power with the following settings: test family=F tests, statistical test=linear multiple regression: Fixed model (R^2 deviation from zero), type of power analysis=a priori, alpha error probability=0.05.
