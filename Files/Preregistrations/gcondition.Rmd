### ABSTRACT
Morphological variation among individuals has the potential to influence multiple life history characteristics such as dispersal, migration, reproductive success, and survival [@wilder2016moving]. Research has shown that individuals that are in better "condition" can disperse or migrate further or more successfully, have greater reproductive success, and survive for longer [@wilder2016moving; @heidinger2010patch; @liao2011fat], particularly in years where environmental conditions are harsh [@milenkaya2015body]. An individual's body condition can be defined in various ways, but is most often considered an individual's energetic or immune state [@milenkaya2015body]. Since these traits are hard to measure directly, researchers have instead used a variety of morphological proxies to quantify condition such as fat score [@kaiser1993new], weight, ratio of weight to tarsus length [@labocha2014body], a scaled mass index [@peig2009new], as well as hematological indices for immune system function [@fleskes2017body; @kraft2019developmental]. However, there is mixed support regarding whether these condition indices relate to life history characteristics [@wilder2016moving; @labocha2014body], and whether the relationship is linear [@mcnamara2005theoretical; @milenkaya2015body]. Additionally, although some researchers use multiple morphological proxies for condition [e.g. @warnock1998spring], rarely have there been direct comparisons among proxies to validate that they measure the same trait. In this investigation, we define condition as an energetic state and we attempt to measure it by comparing two indices (fat score and the scaled mass index) to validate whether they measure the same trait in our study system, the great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus). We found that the morphological proxy variables did not correlate with each other, indicating that they do not measure the same trait. Further, neither proxy correlated with reproductive success in males, measured as whether a male held a territory containing nests or not. We found that females with a high scaled mass index had a significantly lower probability that their nest would survive on any given day.  However, there was no relationship between female fat score and nest survival.  These results improve our understanding of measures of condition in grackles and birds in general. Future research should further investigate our unexpected result that higher scaled mass index led to lower nest survival to better understand the importance of energetic condition for reproductive success - a necessary component for selection to act.

### INTRODUCTION
Morphological variation among individuals has the potential to influence multiple life history characteristics such as dispersal, migration, reproductive fitness, and survival [@wilder2016moving]. One morphological trait that might be particularly likely to influence these life history characteristics is energetic condition. Research has shown that individuals that are in better "condition" can disperse or migrate further or more successfully, have greater reproductive success, and survive for longer [@wilder2016moving; @heidinger2010patch; @liao2011fat], particularly in years where environmental conditions are harsh [@milenkaya2015body]. For example, a study conducted on vipers showed that while the level of fat reserves in males had no effect on their sexual activity, females with low fat reserves engaged in sexual interactions less frequently than those with higher fat reserves [@Aubret2002fat]. In contrast, mantids showed conflicting results regarding the relationship between fat reserves and reproductive success. Female mantids were fed either a high protein, low lipid diet, or a high lipid, low protein diet. The females that received the high lipid diet had higher lipid content in most parts of their body compared to that of their high protein diet counterparts. However, they were not able to produce even half as many eggs as the females fed the high protein, low lipid diet. This led to lower male attraction, measured by the number of copulation events, thus negatively impacting further reproductive success [@Barry2013macronutrient]. 

A variety of morphological proxies have been used to quantify energetic condition [i.e., fat score, weight, ratio of weight to tarsus length, ratio of weight to wing chord length; @labocha2014body]. However, there is mixed support regarding whether and how these proxies relate to life history characteristics [@wilder2016moving; @labocha2014body]. A review conducted by Barnett (2015) shows that, while mass or body size measures of condition are often assumed to have a positive linear relationship with fitness, this is not always the case, and the relationship should first be empirically validated before being used as a proxy [@Barnett2015mass]. In some instances, the condition proxy might relate to life history characteristics, but in an unexpected way. For example, theoretical simulations of small birds show that survival does not increase linearly with energy (i.e. fat) reserves [@mcnamara2005theoretical]. If the reserves are too low, the individual is at risk of starvation. However, once the reserves get too high, the individual is at an increased risk of predation [@mcnamara2005theoretical]. Thus, fat reserves can relate to a life history variable (survival), but in a U-shaped relationship rather than a linear one. 

Although some studies use multiple morphological proxies for condition [e.g. @warnock1998spring], rarely are these variables directly compared. Multiple proxies should correlate with each other if they measure the same trait (energetic condition). Furthermore, there is still confusion about what trait some proxies actually measure. For example, a study conducted on two species of crickets showed that three estimates of body condition based on fat content or on the relationship between body mass and body length (scaled mass index or ordinary least squares regression) did not correlate with each other [@kelly2014evaluating], thus indicating that they do not measure the same trait. This is an example of the jingle fallacy [@block1995contrarian; @carter2013animal], where a single trait label (“condition”) actually encompasses more than one distinct trait. In this case, two studies using different proxies can be conducted on the same research question, using the same species, but may end up with different results. This is problematic because inconsistency in results among researchers can result in potentially misleading interpretations of the impact of variation in morphology on life history and population variables [@stevenson2006condition].

Here we compare two indices (fat score and the scaled mass index) of an individual’s energetic state to validate whether they correlate with each other, which would indicate that they both measure body condition. Fat score, as described by Kaiser (1993), is a numerical estimate of the amount of fat visible under the skin. The score ranges from 0 to 8 depending on the size and appearance of the fat located in the individual’s abdomen and interclavicular depression, with 0 indicating no visible fat and 8 indicating extensive fat covering the ventral surface such that no muscle tissue is visible. For example, a score of 1 corresponds to sparse traces of fat visible in the interclavicular depression and abdomen. This measure has been used frequently in birds [@erciyas2010body; @merila1997fat; @cornelius2019physiological], and is a straightforward, non-invasive method for estimating condition. However, previous research found that it does not always positively relate with life history variables. For example, @haas1998effects found no difference between fat scores in individuals that had successful or failed nests in American robins and brown thrashers, indicating that fat score may not explain much of the variation in nest success in some species. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between fat score measures and life history characteristics.

In contrast, the scaled mass index (SMI) is more difficult to calculate than the fat score, but it has become the predominant ratio method [english2018body; @maceda2014scaled; @delciellos2018habitat] for quantifying energetic condition within and among populations. The SMI is an individual’s mass scaled by skeletal body size [@peig2009new]. Unlike the common alternative which uses a simple ratio of tarsus (lower leg) length to body mass, the SMI accounts for the tendency towards allometric scaling where the relationship between body mass and structural size increases by a power law (Huxley, 1932). When individuals with different structural body sizes can be standardized to the population average structural body size, then energetic condition (the amount of mass not explained by structural body size) can be more directly compared within and across populations. That is, the SMI calculates the energetic condition as the mass of an individual relative to the population by first computing the mass that the individual would have at the population average of a specific body measurement (e.g. tarsus length). Next, structural body size of the individual is standardized by scaling the individual’s structural body length by the population average of that body measurement, which accounts for population differences. The SMI is calculated as: $Mass_i\left[ \frac{AvgLength_p}{Length_i} \right]^slope_p$ where *Mass_i* is each individual’s weight in grams, *Length_i* is the value of the chosen measure of structural body length for each bird, *AvgLength_p* is the average structural body length in the population, and *slope_p* is the value of the slope from a standard major axis regression of structural body size on mass [@peig2009new] which is used to compare variables that were both measured and so have residual error. Therefore, individuals in better energetic condition (larger weight for their structural body size) will have a higher SMI compared to individuals in poor condition. Studies across taxa found that the SMI relates positively to reproductive success and survival. For example, mallards with a lower SMI had lower rates of survival compared to their higher SMI counterparts [@champagnon2012low], while in crimson finches SMI was positively related to the number of young that survived to independence [@milenkaya2015body]. 

Our research will determine whether these two indices of energetic condition measure the same trait, and whether this trait relates to an important life history characteristic- reproductive success. To quantify reproductive success in birds, researchers must find and monitor nests. However, nests are usually built in cryptic locations and parents behave secretly. Additionally, it is very difficult and time-consuming to track the survival of offspring once they leave the nest. Therefore, the predominantly used measure of reproductive success is whether a nest fledged offspring [@mayfield1961nesting]. 

Our study system is a population of great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus), hereafter “grackles”, in Tempe, Arizona. This system is ideal for this investigation because grackles are native to the tropical climates of Central America [@ohnson2001great] but have rapidly expanded into new areas and ecosystems [wehtje2003range]. Because grackles are a water-associated species, the desert habitat of Tempe presents physiological challenges that could lead to an increased likelihood of a tradeoff between survival and reproductive attempts [@henderson2017glucocorticoids]. Deserts are characterized by a scarcity of water and extreme temperature fluctuations, which require behavioral and physiological species adaptations [@costa2012behavioural]. Wide variation in body condition and reproductive success is possible if grackle physiology requires more water than is present in the environment, and some individuals may cope with physiological stress, or find hidden sources of water, better than others [@henderson2017glucocorticoids].  

We compared two measures of body condition in grackles and observed reproductive success to test our hypotheses that 1) variation in fat scores and scaled mass indices will be related if they are measures of the same trait (energetic condition), and 2) that this variation will relate to reproductive success as measured by whether females fledge young and whether males defend a territory containing nests. 

### RESULTS
#### Prediction 1: correlation between SMI and Fat Score
We calculated SMI for 24 males and 62 females.  We had fat score values on 21 males and 47 females. 

We found that wing length was more tightly correlated with body mass than tarsus length in both sexes, therefore we used wing length in our SMI calculations (female n = 62, r = 0.26, p = 0.03; male n = 24, r = 0.35, p = 0.08).   This allows us to account for as much variation in body mass as possible that is associated with skeletal body size because leftover variation in body mass is more likely to relate to energetic condition. Consequently, we used wing length in our calculation of SMI as: $Mass_i\left[ \frac{AvgWing_p}{AvgWing_i} \right]^slope_p$.  *Mass_i* is each individual’s weight in grams, *AvgWing_i* is the average value of the measures of the left and right wing lengths of each bird, *AvgWing_p* is the average wing length in the population, and *slope_p* is the value of the slope from a standard major axis regression of wing length on mass [@peig2009new].

To validate that we were measuring structural body size consistently across experimenters, we analyzed the repeatability of wing length in the birds in our sample that were measured more than once. We found that average wing length was repeatable (n = 17 females, Repeatability ± standard error = 0.53 ± 0.18; n = 18 males, Repeatability ± SE = 0.75 ± 0.11). Data permutations and a likelihood ratio test both confirmed that these repeatability values were statistically significant at p < 0.01. 

##### Unregistered analysis
Warning messages occurred during the repeatability analysis using the rptR package in R [@stoffel2017rptr] indicating that the fit was singular, likely because the variance for the Experimenter random effect in the model for both female and male wing length was 0.001. We thus conducted an unregistered analysis where we confirmed that our repeatability values from the repeatability models were valid despite the warning by hand calculating repeatability following @nakagawa2010repeatability. The hand-calculated repeatabilities were nearly identical (female R = 0.5, male R = 0.71).

We found that fat score was not correlated with SMI, which indicates that they are not measuring the same trait (female  p = 0.81; male p = 0.46; Table 1).  There was also no effect of season (breeding or non-breeding) on female fat score (p = 0.71). Only 2 males were measured during the breeding season, therefore we omitted season as an independent variable in the male model. 

### STATE OF THE DATA

This preregistration uses secondary data that are collected as part of other ongoing  investigations (tarsus length in [flex genes](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexgenes.html); tarsus length, body weight, number of fledglings, and whether a male holds a territory in [within population](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_withinpop.html); and tarsus length in [expansion](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_expansion.html)). This preregistration was written (July 2019) and submitted to Peer Community In Ecology for pre-study peer review (August 2019) before any analyses were conducted.

**After pre-study peer review: how the actual methods differed from the planned methods**
#### NOTE (Oct 2020): 
1) We realized that the sexual dimorphism of male and female body sizes necessitates separate analyses.  Therefore, we calculated SMI for males and females separately, ran separate models for each sex for the repeatibility analysis, P1 and P2.
2) Fat score data were distributed such that the majority of scores were 0, with some 1's and very few higher numbers. This made it difficult to fit models using an ordinal regression.  The function simulateResiduals, which we used to check our data, does not work with data in the ordinal family. Consequently, we used logistic regression where the dependent variable FatScore represents no fat (score = 0), or some fat (score = 1).
##### P1: Fat score and SMI are correlated
3) Despite the data checking which indicated our model was not overdispersed or zero inflated, we could not get the fixed effects or random effect to converge using the Bayesian MCMCglmm. We found no improvement in model fit by tweaking the priors or iterations/burnin/thin options. Therefore, we fit these models using the function glmer, a frequentist framework.
4) The Season variable only includes 2 males in the breeding season category, thus we do not have a large enough sample to produce reliable estimates. We removed the Season variable from the model for males.


### HYPOTHESES

#### H1: There is a relationship between two different morphological indices of condition: fat score and the scaled mass index.

**Prediction 1:**  Fat score and the scaled mass index will be positively correlated. This would indicate that these two indices measure the same trait, and it is likely they both are proxies for fat content.

**Prediction 1 alternative 1:** There is a negative correlation between fat score and the scaled mass index. This would indicate that there may be a tradeoff between the two indices where a larger value of the scaled mass index may measure muscle content rather than fat, and individuals with more muscle have less visible fat.

**Prediction 1 alternative 2:** There is no correlation between fat score and the scaled mass index. This indicates that these two variables do not measure the same trait. Fat score may not adequately capture a bird’s condition because birds may be selected to only store the minimal fat necessary to prevent starvation, while also minimizing the weight gain that would make them easier targets for predators (@barnett2015mass). Similarly, the scaled mass index could be heavily influenced by body size, therefore reflecting structural size rather than fat storage (@labocha2012morphometric).

#### H2: Condition (as measured by fat score and the scaled mass index) relates to reproductive success (measured as a binary variable of whether a female had one or more fledglings (1) or not (0), and whether a male defended a territory containing nests (1) or not (0)). 

**Prediction 2:** Morphological indices of condition (fat score and the scaled mass index) will correlate positively with reproductive success. This would indicate that individuals with more fat, and therefore higher energy reserves, are better able to acquire the resources necessary for reproduction.

**Prediction 2 alternative 1:** Morphological indices of condition (fat score and the scaled mass index) will correlate negatively with reproductive success. This indicates that individuals may make trade offs, with some acquiring more food and increasing their energy reserves, and others prioritizing reproductive activities over increasing energy reserves.

**Prediction 2 alternative 2:** Morphological indices of condition (fat score and the scaled mass index) do not correlate with reproductive success. This indicates that other, potentially non-morphological, individual characteristics relate to reproductive success (i.e., cognition, nest site selection, breeding experience, predator vigilance, etc.).

### C. METHODS

#### **Planned Sample**

Great-tailed grackles are caught in the wild in Tempe, Arizona using a variety of methods (e.g., walk-in trap, bownet, mist net). After capture we immediately process birds by attaching colored leg bands in unique combinations for individual identification, conducting morphological measurements of weight, tarsus length, flattened wing length, tail length, skull length, bill length and fat score (the amount of visible fat under the skin in the clavicle and abdomen as in @kaiser1993new). Most grackles are released after completion of color band marking, measurements, and acquiring a blood sample. A subset of grackles are held in aviaries for up to 6 months for behavioral testing, and then released back to the wild at their location of capture.

From March - August, we monitor the behavior of all color-marked grackles to determine their nesting status. We follow females carrying nesting materials to find their nest. We determine whether the male territory owner is color-marked as well. Then we check each nest approximately every day to determine the status based on the female’s behavior (building, incubation, feeding nestlings, feeding fledglings, failed).

Individuals included in this sample will be those for which we have measures of condition when they were adults. We will not include individuals whose data were collected as juveniles. As of 30 July 2019, we have fledgling data for 14 females that exhibited breeding behavior (5 had 1+ fledgling, 9 had no fledglings) and breeding territory status for 10 males (7 territory holders, 3 non-territory holders, 2 not observed so not part of this sample). Therefore, the minimum sample size for H2 will be 24. The minimum sample size for H1 will be 72, because that is how many marked individuals we have biometric data for so far. However, we expect to be able to add to the sample size for both H1 and H2 before the end of this investigation in Tempe, Arizona.

#### **Sample size rationale**

We will continue to color mark as many grackles as possible, and collect biometric data and fat scores. Our current sample of reproductive success is small because the grackles in Tempe nest in very tall palms, making it difficult to determine nest status. However, we plan to collect additional reproductive success data during the breeding season in summer 2020. 

#### **Data collection stopping rule**

We will stop collecting data for this project in early August 2020 when research at the Tempe, Arizona field site will be finished.

####**Open data**

When the study is complete, the data will be published in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity's data repository.

#### **Randomization and counterbalancing**

There is no randomization or counterbalancing in this investigation. 

#### **Blinding of conditions during analysis**

No blinding is involved in this investigation.

#### **Dependent Variables**

**P1: correlation between fat and the scaled mass index**

1) Fat score (the amount of visible fat under the skin in the clavicle and abdomen reported as a score from 0 (no fat) to 8 (fat completely covers muscles and underside of the bird); @kaiser1993new)

**P2: condition and reproductive success**

1) Female had one or more fledglings (yes, no)

2) Male held a territory consisting of 1 to 3 clumped palms containing nests (yes, no)


#### **Independent Variables**

**P1: correlation between fat and the scaled mass index**

1) Scaled mass index using measures of body weight and tarsus length or flattened wing length (average of left and right as in @bleeker2005body). We will choose the measure that is most correlated with body weight (@peig2009new).

2) Season (non-breeding [Sep-Feb], breeding [Mar-Aug]). NOTE (Oct 2020): The Season variable only includes 2 males in the breeding season category, thus we do not have a large enough sample to produce reliable estimates. We removed the Season variable from the model for males.

3) Random effect: Experimenter (because several different experimenters measure dependent variables on multiple different birds)

**P2: condition and reproductive success**

1) Fat score 
   - Note 1: if the fat score and the scaled mass index are positively correlated, then we will use only fat score in the model for P2. If they are not positively correlated, then we will add the scaled mass index as an independent variable in the P2 analysis
   - Note 2: if fat score and/or the scaled mass index vary by season (breeding or non-breeding), then we will only use the data from the breeding season to ensure that less time has elapsed between the collection of condition and reproductive success variables

2) Temporarily held in aviaries for behavioral testing at any point during this study, because this may affect breeding behaviors (yes, no)

3) Random effect: Year (to determine whether conditions in a given breeding season similarly affected all grackle behavior and nest success)

4) Random effect: Bird ID (because there may be multiple measures of reproductive success for each bird)

### D. ANALYSIS PLAN
####NOTE (Oct 2020)
*1) We realized that the sexual dimorphism of male and female body sizes necessitates separate analyses.  Therefore, we calculated SMI for males and females separately, ran separate models for each sex for the repeatibility analysis, P1 and P2.*
*2) Fat score data were distributed such that the majority of scores were 0, with some 1's and very few higher numbers. This made it difficult to fit models using an ordinal regression.  The function simulateResiduals, which we used to check our data, does not work with data in the ordinal family. Consequently, we used logistic regression where the dependent variable FatScore represents no fat (score = 0), or some fat (score = 1)*
*3) Despite the data checking which indicated our model was not overdispersed or zero inflated, we could not get the fixed effects or random effect to converge using the Bayesian MCMCglmm. We found no improvement in model fit by tweaking the priors or iterations/burnin/thin options. Therefore, we fit these models using the function glmer, a frequentist framework.
4) The Season variable only includes 2 males in the breeding season category, thus we do not have a large enough sample to produce reliable estimates. We removed the Season variable from the model for males.*

We will **exclude** data that was collected from the grackles when they were released from the aviaries to avoid any confounds due to their time in the aviary (e.g., perhaps unlimited nutritious food in the aviaries decreased their fat score). However, to validate that our measures of structural body size (tarsus length or wing length) are precise and accurate, we will measure twice a subset of grackles brought into aviaries - once when they are initially caught, and again up to 6 months later when we release them. We will then calculate the repeatability of these multiple measures. All other data  included in this study will come only from wild-caught grackles (including the birds that were brought into the aviaries on their first capture). When **missing data** occur, the existing data for that individual will be included in the analyses for which their data exist. Analyses will be conducted in R (current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam). 

####*Ability to detect actual effects*

To begin to understand what kinds of effect sizes we will be able to detect given our sample size limitations, we used G&ast;Power (v.3.1, @faul2007g, @faul2009statistical) to conduct power analyses based on confidence intervals. G&ast;Power uses pre-set drop down menus and we chose the options that were as close to our analysis methods as possible (listed in each analysis below). Note that there were no explicit options for GLMMs, thus the power analyses are only an approximation of the kinds of effect sizes we can detect. We realize that these power analyses are not fully aligned with our study design and that these kinds of analyses are not appropriate for Bayesian statistics (e.g., our MCMCglmm below), however we are unaware of better options at this time. Additionally, it is difficult to run power analyses because it is unclear what kinds of effect sizes we should expect due to the lack of data on this species for these particular research questions.

####*Data checking*

The data will be checked for overdispersion, underdispersion, zero-inflation, and heteroscedasticity with the DHARMa R package [@Hartig2019dharma] following methods by [Hartig](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html). 

#### *P1 analysis: correlation between fat and the scaled mass index*

**Analysis:** We will calculate the scaled mass index as described by @peig2009new using either tarsus or flattened wing length - whichever measure is most correlated with body weight (@peig2009new). 

We use a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM; MCMCglmm function, MCMCglmm package; (Hadfield 2010)) with an ordinal distribution (for categorical variables in MCMCglmm) and probit link using 130,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 10, a burnin of 30,000, and minimal priors (V=1, nu=0) (Hadfield 2014). We will ensure the GLMM shows acceptable convergence (lag time autocorrelation values <0.01; (Hadfield 2010)), and adjust parameters if necessary to meet this criterion. We will determine whether an independent variable had an effect or not using the Estimate in the full model.

Where we have multiple measures of tarsus or flattened wing length, we will check that our measurements are repeatable using the rptR package (@stoffel2017rptr).

To roughly estimate our ability to detect actual effects (because these power analyses are designed for frequentist statistics, not Bayesian statistics), we ran a power analysis in G\*Power with the following settings: test family=F tests, statistical test=linear multiple regression: Fixed model (R^2 deviation from zero), type of power analysis=a priori, alpha error probability=0.05. We changed the power and the effect size until we reached an output that we project our sample size will be (n=90). The number of predictor variables was restricted to only the fixed effects because this test was not designed for mixed models. The protocol of the power analysis is here:

*Input:*

Effect size f²                	=	0.15

α err prob                    	=	0.05

Power (1-β err prob)          	=	0.86

Number of predictors          	=	3

*Output:*

Noncentrality parameter λ     	=	13.3500000

Critical F                    	=	2.7119214

Numerator df                  	=	3

Denominator df                	=	85

Total sample size             	=	89

Actual power                  	=	0.8635760

This means that, with a sample size of 89, we would have an 86% chance of detecting a medium effect (approximated at f^2^=0.15 by @cohen1988statistical).

### H1 - data checking

## UREGISTERED ANALYSIS - Fat score data were distributed such that the majority of scores were 0, with some 1's and very few higher numbers. This made it difficult to fit models using ordinal regression.  Furthermore, the function simulateResiduals does not work with data in family "ordinal". Consequently, we used logistic regression where the dependent variable FatScore represents no fat (score = 0), or some fat (score = 1+).
## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - As above, need to run all models separately for males and females

#### *P2 analysis: condition and reproductive success*

To model the effect of body condition on reproductive success, we will use two types of logistic mixed-effect models. Both types are supported in the literature, but are slightly different in the way in which the link function is specified. First, we will model reproductive success using a generalized linear mixed model framework with a logit link function (i.e. @milenkaya2015body). We will also use a logistic exposure model that has a link function which accounts for the time interval between nest checks when estimating the probability of daily nest survival (@shaffer2004unified; @bolker2014logistic). If fat score and the scaled mass index are positively correlated in P1, then we will use only fat score as the independent variable in this GLMM. If they are not positively correlated, we will include both as independent variables.

Previous research found a non-linear relationship between reproductive success and body condition variables (@milenkaya2015body). To check whether this is occurring in our data, we will first plot our raw data to determine if we need to include a non-linear body condition independent variable into our model (i.e. FatScore^2^). Our dependent variable is binary, so to more clearly see the trends in the data, on the x-axis we will bin our condition scores into 5 categories based on standard deviations (sd) around the mean (low = < 2 sd, moderately low = -2 sd to -1 sd, moderate = -1 sd to +1 sd, moderately high = +1 sd to +2 sd, high = > 2 sd). Then on the y-axis we will use the proportion of individuals in each category that had successful nests.

A power analysis was conducted as above for P1 and the protocol reported here:

*Input:*

Effect size f²                	=	0.15

α err prob                    	=	0.05

Power (1-β err prob)          	=	0.90

Number of predictors          	=	2

*Output:*

Noncentrality parameter λ     	=	13.2000000

Critical F                    	=	3.1038387

Numerator df                  	=	2

Denominator df                	=	85

Total sample size             	=	88

Actual power                  	=	0.9020264

This means that, with a sample size of 88, we would have a 90% chance of detecting a medium effect (approximated at f^2^=0.15 by @cohen1988statistical).

This made it difficult to fit models using ordinal regression.  Furthermore, the function simulateResiduals does not work with data in family "ordinal". Consequently, we used logistic regression where the dependent variable FatScore represents no fat (score = 0), or some fat (score = 1+).

# Females
bs_f <- lm(Body2 ~ Season,  data = d_f) # only need one row per bird
plot(bs_f) 
hist(resid(bs_f)) #Looks normal
summary(bs_f) # SMI does not vary with season - do NOT need to include Season in H2 analyses

d_f2 = na.omit(d_f)
fs_f <- glm(Fatbin ~ Season, data = d_f2, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(fs_f) # Fat score does not vary with season


# Males
bs_m <- lm(Body2 ~ Season,  data = d_m[-which(is.na(d_m$Body2)),]) 
plot(bs_m) 
hist(resid(bs_m)) #Looks mostly normal, a little uniform
summary(bs_m) # SMI does not vary with season - do NOT need to include Season in H2 analyses

d_m2 = na.omit(d_m)
fs_m <- glm(Fatbin ~ Season, data = d_m2, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(fs_m) # Just like in H1, not enough Fat score data on males in the breeding season to reliably estimate a relationship.

summary(m_frs) # Cannot get model to converge. Even if we increase nitt, thin and burnin we get the Error: Mixed model equations singular: use a (stronger) prior

## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - Due to the error above, we dropped the Year random effect to try to get the model to converge.
m_frs <- MCMCglmm(Fledglings ~ FatScore + Body2 + Aviary, random = ~ID,

autocorr(m_frs$Sol) #Did fixed effects converge?
autocorr(m_frs$VCV) #Did random effects converge?

## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - Due to the error above, we instead analyse these data using a frequentist method.
m_frs1 = glmer(Fledglings ~ FatScore + Body2 + Aviary + (1|Year) + (1|ID), family = binomial(link="logit"), data = h2_f) # Yes, fit is still singular and variance of random effects is close to 0
m_frs2 = glmer(Fledglings ~ FatScore + Body2 + Aviary + (1|ID), family = binomial(link="logit"), data = h2_f) # Yes, fit is still singular and variance of random effects is close to 0

##  UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - The variance of the ID random effect is essentially 0, so the model fit is singular.  There are only 2 females with data from 2019 and 2020.  Remove reproductive success data of these females from 2020 because condition data were collected in 2019 so it is more likely to impact their reproductive success that year.

summary(m_mrs) # Estimates and CIs are abnormally large.
autocorr(m_mrs$Sol) # Looks like it converges, but estimates and CIs remain abnormally large
autocorr(m_mrs$VCV) # Cannot get this to converge

## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - We could not get the MCMCglmm to fit by tweaking the priors or iterations/burnin/thin options.  We therefore cannot rely on the results from those models and we switched to using a frequentist logistic regression model.
m_mrs1 = glmer(Territory ~ FatScore + Body2 + Aviary + (1|Year) + (1|ID), family = binomial(link="logit"), data = h2_m) # fit is singular - random effects accounts for 0 variance
m_mrs2 = glmer(Territory ~ FatScore + Body2 + Aviary + (1|ID), family = binomial(link="logit"), data = h2_m) # fit is still singular. ID random effect accounts for 0 variance - but need to keep because 25% of data are repeated males.
summary(m_mrs2) ## Is this still okay to present?






## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - The variance of the ID random effect is essentially 0, so the model fit is singular.  There are 5 males with data from 2019 and 2020 (25%).  Only keep reproductive success data of these males in the year condition data were collected so it is more likely to impact their reproductive success that year.

table(h2_m2$Territory, h2_m2$Aviary) # That is likely because in our sample there are no males that failed to defend a territory and were not in the aviaries.  So there is not enough variance in this variable to get a reliable estimate.

## UNREGISTERED ANALYSIS - Due to the problem discovered above, we dropped the Aviary covariate from the model.

Our measure of female nest success could be systematically biased against nests that failed early [@shaffer2004unified). Consequently, we also analyzed female reproductive success using a logistic exposure model. This type of model determines the factors affecting daily nest survivial probability.

    exposure
  }

We did not find any effect of time spent in the aviaries, day of the year, or fat score. However, we found that higher SMI related to decreased probability of daily nest survival.
