Tempe,30-Sep-19,MM,3,Diablo,1,8,10,09:01,n,-1,,,Removed 08:04 (Brookes put the food back in after cleaning for 10-15 mins),"Sept-30-2019: After he timed out (5 mins no participate), we put yellow tubes into aviary facing back (tubes and food visible) and he participated immediately by eating all the food from both tubes. Next we put yellow tubes into aviary facing sides (tube not visible; one piece of food visible on top) and he did not participate for 5 minutes, thus timed out. We gave him a break until 10:11. Put yellow tubes back in (tubes not visible, food on top visible) and he did not come down for 3 minutes; at 10:14 moved tubes to face rear of aviaries (tubes visible) and put a 3rd piece of food at the opening of the tube (food visible at opening and on top of yellow tubes). Took tubes away at 10:18. Corina thought because he is a fast working bird, we were just waiting for him to time out and he clearly was not interested in participating. Tried again at 11:02 with 2 yellow tubes (tube and food visible). We added more food on top of tube at 11:05. Added a full cracker between the tubes at 11:07, which he ate. He ate from one tube at 11:08 and then the next. Next we did food and tube visible at 11:12. At 11:15 we put pieces at the front of the tube (food and tube visible). Took away at 11:18. Tried again at 11:40 (tubes visible food visible at front of tube). Added food to top of tubes at 11:44 - he came down and ate all then investigated the tubes until 11:49. Placed again at 11:51 (tube and food visible - ate all from both tubes (2 each). Put again 11:54 tube visible food not visible. Came down right away. 11:57 yellow tube and food not visible. Came down right away. Again 11:59 food and tube not visible. He came down after 3 minutes and ate from within both tubes. Ending on a high note. Oct-01-2019: Goal1 3x tube and food not visible (eat out of both), followed by Boal 23x food and tube not visible but only allowed to eat out of 1 tube although both will have food. Goal1: 10:34 came down within 1 min and ate from both tubes; 10:39 came down within 20 seconds and ate from both tubes; 10:42 came down within 10 seconds ate ate from both tubes; Goal 2: 10:42 good; 10:46; 10:47 good."

He came down and ate the bait and did not make a choice (flew to water and then up).

Tempe,2-Oct-19,MM,3,Diablo,1,14,18,12:15,n,-1,,,,He came down and looked at the sides of the light grey tube but did not look in it. It seemed as though he felt he'd participated and he flew up to his perch after that. 20 minute break (12:41)
