### ABSTRACT

This is one of the first studies planned for our long-term research on the role of behavioral flexibility in rapid geographic range expansions. **Project background:** Behavioral flexibility, the ability to change behavior when circumstances change based on learning from previous experience (@mikhalevich_is_2017), is thought to play an important role in a species' ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range (e.g., @lefebvre1997feeding, @griffin2014innovation, @chow2016practice, @sol2000behavioural, @sol2002behavioural, @sol2005big). However, behavioral flexibility is rarely directly tested at the individual level, thus limiting our ability to determine how it relates to other traits (e.g., behavior, invasion success, diet generalism, foraging techniques, foraging innovations, mortality, brain size), which limits the power of predictions about a species' ability to adapt behavior to new environments. We use great-tailed grackles (a bird species) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 140 years (i.e., they increased their nesting range by over 5500% between 1880 and 2000 [@wehtje2003range], [@peer2011invasion]) (Fig. 1). Foraging behavior is considered central to the rapid geographic range expansion of this species and it is thought that they have been so successful by following human urban and agricultural corridors (@wehtje2003range, @peer2011invasion). Therefore, as humans continue to modify landscapes, this increases the amount of suitable grackle habitat. We expect this species to be behaviorally flexible because they are fast at reversal learning (@logan2016behavioral), they often encounter human-made "puzzle boxes" in the wild as they attempt to open packaging to access food when digging through garbage cans and eating at outdoor cafes, and they may track resources across time and space. Results will allow us to determine whether, as predicted by hypotheses and cross-species correlational data, in this expanding species, individual-level variation in flexibility is linked with diet breadth, foraging proficiency, social interactions, habitat use, and movement into new geographic areas. **This investigation**: In this piece of the long-term project, we will assess whether individual performance in experiments that assess behavioral flexibility relates to individual variation in ecological and social behavior in the natural environment. In particular, we aim to determine whether the more behaviorally flexible (measured by reversal learning and solution switching on a multi-access box in a separate [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md)) grackles have more flexible foraging behavior (eat a larger number of different foods, use a wider variety of foraging techniques), are more flexible in their habitat use (are found in more diverse habitat types, disperse farther from their natal area), and are more flexible in their social relationships (have more or stronger social bonds particularly with less related individuals). We will be able to compare the grackle's ability to adapt behavior according to social context with data from other species, as well as determine whether it is linked with measures of flexibility in asocial contexts.  


## INTRODUCTION



### HYPOTHESES

#### H1: [Behavioral flexibility](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md) [see @mikhalevich_is_2017 for a detailed definition] is related to foraging behavior (measured with focal follows using this [ethogram](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8wsA3geaRGlMjRxYTRpdG2i5oCXNGq9zBlTnj02Gho/edit?usp=sharing)) in wild individuals (after their release from the aviaries). We measure flexibility in aviaries using two paradigms: reversal learning [where grackles must learn to prefer one of two options that contain food and then reverse this preference] and switching between options on a multi-access box (where grackles must learn to switch to a new option, out of four available options, when an option becomes non-functional). We expect this species to be behaviorally flexible because they are fast at reversal learning [@logan2016behavioral], they often encounter human-made "puzzle boxes" in the wild as they attempt to open packaging to access food when digging through garbage cans and eating at outdoor cafes, and they may track resources across time and space. Foraging behavior is considered central to the rapid geographic range expansion of this species and it is thought that they have been so successful by following human urban and agricultural corridors [@wehtje2003range; @peer2011invasion]. Therefore, as humans continue to modify landscapes, this increases the amount of suitable grackle habitat.

**Prediction 1:** Individuals that are faster to reverse preferences on a reversal learning task and who also have lower latencies to switch to solving new loci after previously solved loci become unavailable (multi-access box) will eat a larger number of different foods and use a wider variety of foraging techniques in the wild, validating the cross-species correlational finding that technique breadth [@overington2009technical] and diet breadth [@ducatez2015ecological] is associated with flexibility.

**P1 alternative 1:** If there is no correlation, this suggests that flexibility as we measured it represents a trait that is not related to the number of foods eaten and foraging techniques used. Flexibility may not necessarily be associated with diet and foraging technique breadth because flexibility could be constrained in a foraging context due to social competition (e.g., subordinates are outcompeted while foraging and thus try new foods and techniques) or ecological limitations (e.g., constrained by what is available). Additional research would be required to determine the factors that might constrain foraging behavior.

**P1 alternative 2:** If there is a negative correlation between flexibility and the number of different foods eaten, this might indicate that the more flexible individuals target particular food items. If this prediction is supported, we will conduct an additional analysis to examine what food types the more flexible grackles eat and whether these food types are potentially more valuable (measured as having more calories).

**P1 alternative 3:** If there is a negative correlation between flexibility and the number of foraging techniques, this could indicate that the more flexible individuals use particular (potentially more effective) techniques.

**P2:** Individuals whose [flexibility](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md) has been increased experimentally will consume a larger number of foods and use more foraging techniques (measured with focal follows) than individuals whose flexibility has not been manipulated. This would further validate that flexibility is related to diet breadth and foraging techniques. 

**P2 alternative 1:** If the flexibility manipulation does not work in that those individuals in the experimental condition do not decrease their reversal learning speeds more than control individuals, then we will rely on the general individual variation in flexibility and how it relates to foraging in the wild (as in P1).

**P3:** The proportion of a grackle's diet that is human foods and the proportion of their foraging techniques involving human foods is higher for the more flexible individuals, who will consistently occur in locations closer to known outdoor human food locations like picnic areas and outdoor cafe seating (measured as the repeatability of the individual's distance from cafes across multiple separate focal follows) OR who will occupy a home range that contains more outdoor human food locations. For the diet, this is potentially due to A) having stayed in their parent's home range (i.e., they eat human food because it happens to be more prevalent in their home range than in other home ranges; local specialization) or B) because these individuals move around to seek out such opportunities (potentially seeking out habitat edges within their population). For the foraging techniques, this is potentially due to human foods and their packaging changing at a faster rate than natural foods and prey items and their accessibility. Foods  eaten and foraging techniques used will be recorded during focal follows. Because this species is highly associated with human-modified landscapes, it is likely that consuming human foods is part of the reason for this association, and that flexible individuals are better at solving these human-made "puzzle boxes" to access food.

**P3 alternative 1:** There is no correlation between an individual's flexibility and the proportion of human foods in their diet, potentially because A) their daily range sizes encompass many different food resources, including human foods (though they are likely not specialized on human foods), and B) some less flexible individuals might specialize on human foods.

**P3 alternative 2:** There is a negative correlation between an individual's flexibility and the proportion of human foods in their diet, potentially because some of the less flexible individuals might specialize on human foods, thus increasing their consumption above that of the more flexible individuals.

#### H2: [Behavioral flexibility](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md) [see @mikhalevich_is_2017 for a detailed definition] is related to social behavior (measured year-round with focal follows using this [ethogram](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8wsA3geaRGlMjRxYTRpdG2i5oCXNGq9zBlTnj02Gho/edit?usp=sharing)) in wild individuals. Flexibility is measured in aviaries using two paradigms: reversal learning and switching between options on a multi-access box. To give an example of the types of social relationships this sexually dimorphic species engages in, they forage and roost socially [@selander1961analysis] and they have a non-faithful-ffale frank polygynous mating system [@johnson2000male]. In terms of male social relationships, @johnson2000male found during the breeding season in a population in Texas that one or more territorial males defend a territory with several nests from ffales, that non-territory holding resident males will queue to gain access to a territory, and that transient males move from colony to colony. There could be varying needs for males to manage their relationships with each other in breeding and non-breeding seasons, and flexibility could potentially play a role in such management.

**P4** Flexible individuals are more likely to have a greater number of bonds OR stronger bonds with others, in particular with individuals who are less related, potentially because they are better able to adjust their behavior to that of an affiliate. Social bonds are measured using the focal follow method to sample affiliative and aggressive behaviors.

**P4 alternative 1:** Individual flexibility is not related to the number or strength of social bonds, potentially because all individuals are able to form bonds with like individuals, including the less flexible individuals.

**P4 alternative 2:** Flexible individuals may have fewer affiliates or be less likely to regularly affiliate with the same individuals, potentially because they frequently change their behavior and are difficult to associate with. We are not able to test this alternative in this study, but could propose experimental designs for future research if this alternative is supported by the data.


## METHODS

Please see our preregistration that received in principle acceptance at PCI Ecology [PDF](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/Files/Preregistrations/g_flexforagingPassedPreStudyPeerReviewOn6Aug2019.pdf) for the preregistered methods. We include here a summary of the methods and describe the deviations from the preregistration. We present the results from different hypotheses from the preregistration in two separate articles: Hypotheses 1 and 2 are in this article, and Hypothesis 3 is in @logan2022flexforaginghabitatuse.

### Planned sample and data collection stopping rule

Great-tailed grackles (n > 200) were caught in the wild at three field sites across their geographic range: the center of their original range (at a site to be determined in Central America), the middle of the northward expanding edge (Tempe, Arizona USA), and on the northern expanding edge (Sacramento, California USA). Individuals were identified using colored leg bands in unique combinations, their data collected (blood, feathers, and biometrics), and then they were released back to the wild. Some individuals (64-100, minimum 60) were brought temporarily into aviaries for behavioral testing, and then released back to the wild where the data for this study were collected. We will stop collecting data in April 2023 when the current funding ends, or after data have been collected at all three field sites, whichever date comes first.

 - **Deviation from the plan:** We originally planned to collect data from three field sites: the middle of the northward expanding edge (Tempe, Arizona), on the northern expanding edge (this ended up being in Sacramento, California), and at a site in the center of their original range (Central America). We ended up not being able to run the Central American site because the research station we were planning on using as the base for the site was exposed for having decades of sexual abuse toward women. We did not feel comfortable being at that station or bringing our business there, and it was too late to find another site because they take years to set up. Therefore, we have data only from two field sites and not three. This also means our sample size was not >200 grackles as originally planned. Our sample size ended up being 66 grackles with focal follow data in Arizona and 32 grackles in California, for a total of 98. We had also planned on bringing at least 60 of these grackles into the aviaries for behavioral choice tests. Of the grackles we brought into the aviaries, 49 (20 in Arizona and 19 in California) ended up completing their reversal learning experiment. We stopped collecting data in December 2022 when the California field site's data collection was complete.

#### Open data

The data, scripts, and code are available at the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity's data repository [@logan2022flexforagingdata].


#### Dependent variables

***P1-P2***

1) Number of different foods eaten in the first X minutes (X=the sum of the total observation time per individual, using the individual who had the lowest sum to equalize observation time across individuals)

2) Number of foraging techniques used (based on Table 1 in @overington2009technical) in the first X minutes (X=the sum of the total observation time per individual, using the individual who had the lowest sum to equalize observation time across individuals)

One model will be run per dependent variable.

***P1 alternative 2 additional analysis: flexible = more valuable food types***

Food type (listed under the What modifier in the Eat behavior in the [ethogram](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8wsA3geaRGlMjRxYTRpdG2i5oCXNGq9zBlTnj02Gho/edit?usp=sharing))

***P3: flexible = more human foods***

1) Proportion of diet per individual that is human food

2) Distance to outdoor human food areas during focal follows

3) Number of outdoor human food areas within the home range

***P4: flexible = a greater number of bonds or stronger bonds***

1) Strength of the maximum bond (calculated as the half-weight index based on association behavior during focal follows. See Analysis Plan > P4 for a complete description). 

2) Individual strength (the sum of all bonds an individual has; @wey2008social)

3) Individual degree (maximum number of other individuals that the focal subject associated with; @wey2008social).

4) Male shares territory with another male: yes, no

5) Relatedness for the strongest bond (measured following the protocol in @thrasher2018double to estimate pairwise relatedness between all individuals based on the extent of sharing of genetic variants as determined by ddRADseq)

#### Independent variables

***P1-P4***

1) Flexibility 1: **Number of trials to reverse** a preference in the last reversal (in the reversal learning experiment) an individual experienced (individuals in the flexibility control group only experience 1 reversal so this data will come from their first and only reversal; individuals in the flexibility manipulation group experience serial reversals until they pass a certain criterion, therefore we will only use data from their most recent reversal). An individual is considered to have a preference if it chose the rewarded option at least 17 out of the most recent 20 trials, with a minimum of 8 or 9 correct choices out of 10 on the two most recent sets of 10 trials). See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md).

2) Flexibility 3: If the number of trials to reverse a preference does not positively correlate with the number of trials to attempt or solve (meet criterion) new loci on the multi-access box (an additional measure of behavioral flexibility), then the **number of trials to solve** and the **number of trials to attempt** a new option on the multi-access box will be additional dependent variables. See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md).

3) Flexibility 4: This measure is currently being developed and is intended be a more accurate representation of all of the choices an individual made, as well as accounting for the degree of uncertainty exhibited by individuals as preferences change. It will be based on a Bayesian estimate of the reduction in error across trials estimated from the number of correct choices from the beginning of each reversal. If this measure more effectively represents flexibility (determined using a modeled dataset and not the actual data), we may decide to solely rely on this measure and not use flexibility measures 1 through 3. If this ends up being the case, we will modify the code in the analysis plan below to reflect this change.

4) Flexibility manipulation: control, manipulated

5) Dominance rank: measured as the number of wins minus the number of losses, divided by the sum of wins + losses. This calculation will give each individual a dominance rank number, and we will order individuals by rank from lowest to highest to create a dominance hierarchy.

6) Condition: aviary-tested, not-aviary-tested

7) ID (random effect because multiple measures per individual)

8) Population: center (Central America), middle (Arizona), edge (northern US) (random effect because each population might have a different slope)

***P1 alternative 2 additional analysis: flexible = more valuable food types***

Flexibility 1 (as above)



#### ANALYSIS PLAN

We did not exclude any data. When missing data occurred, the existing data for that individual was included in the analyses for the tests they completed. Analyses were conducted in R [current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam], using several R packages: @kableextra, @stargazer, @hadfieldMCMCglmmpackage, @mumin, @rethinking2020, @rstan, @formatr, @rstudioapi, @rcpp, @ggplot2, knitr [@xie2018knitr; @xie2017dynamic; @xie2013knitr], @dplyr, @cmdstanr, posterior [@burkner2020posterior], cowplot [@wilkecowplot], bayesplot [@gabry2019visualization], irr [@gamer2012package], psych [@revelle2014psych; @psych], @reactable, DHARMa [@Hartig2019dharma], lme4 [@lme4; @bates2012lme4]. When there was more than one experimenter within a test, experimenter was added as a random effect to account for potential differences between experimenters in conducting the tests. When there are no differences between models including or excluding experimenter as a random effect, then we use the model without this random effect for simplicity. We analyzed data for ffales and males separately because each sex has a distinct natural history.

 - **Deviation from the plan:** We removed experimenter (random variable) from all analyses because the interobserver reliability scores were so high, indicating there was no difference between experimenters, therefore we could keep our models simpler by leaving this variable out.

#### Calculating the independent variable Flexibility 4 (phis and lambdas)

We used the phis and lambdas from each bird's initial discrimination plus first reversal (for the CA birds and AZ control birds) or the last two reversals (for the AZ manipulated birds). We calculated the phis and lambdas using the model and code from @lukas2022flexmanip, and entered these into the data sheets used for the analyses in the results section.

```{r phislambdas, eval=FALSE}

#### Data checking

The data will be checked for overdispersion, underdispersion, zero-inflation, and heteroscedasticity with the DHARMa R package [@Hartig2019dharma] following methods by [Hartig](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html). Note: DHARMa doesn't support MCMCglmm, therefore we will use the closest supported model: glmer from the R package lme4 [@lme4].

#### Ability to detect actual effects

To begin to understand what kinds of effect sizes we will be able to detect given our sample size limitations and our interest in decreasing noise by attempting to measure it, which increases the number of explanatory variables, we will revise the Analysis Plan after reading @statrethinkingbook. We currently don’t have any estimates for any of our measured variables because these tests have never been done in grackles and we have not encountered previous research that has manipulated flexibility in this way. We will use Bayesian analyses to estimate our likely confidence in the results given simulated data. We will revise this preregistration to include these new analyses before conducting the planned analyses on our actual data. Based on the simulations, we might adapt the number of focal follows per individual or decide to collect much more data just with the aviary-tested birds to increase the amount of information per individual.

### Deviations from the prepregistration

**In the middle of data collection**

 - Because all models only include aviary-tested birds for our analyses, Condition (IV6), which indicates whether a bird is aviary-tested or not-aviary-tested, does not need to be included as an independent variable as we originally indicated. (13 July 2022)
 - The Flexibility 4 independent variable calculates the phi and lambda of aviary-tested birds, and as such, it is redundant to include IV4: Flexibility manipulation as an independent variable in the analysis. (13 July 2022)
 - Initially, the dependent variables for P1 and P2 calculated the number of different foods eaten and the number of foraging techniques used in the first X minutes of a focal follow. To equalize observation time across individuals, X minutes was the total observation time using the individual with the lowest sum across all individuals. As we started to clean the data and prepare it for analysis, we noticed three individuals had no focal follows (sum focal time = 0) and the next lowest sum focal time was 497 seconds. The average sum focal time across all 38 individuals was 3024 seconds, leaving an excess of data that would be excluded given the originally prescribed calculation of the dependent variables. Therefore, we changed this to a proportion and divided the number of different foods eaten and the number of foraging techniques used by an individual with the sum observation time across that individual’s focal follows. The analysis for the P1 and P2 dependent variables accommodated this change by adjusting from a poisson to a binomial distribution. (3 August 2022)


## RESULTS

### P1: FLexibility and foraging behavior 

#### Analysis plan: P1-P2

**Analysis:** Because the independent variables could influence each other, we will analyze them in a single model: Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM; MCMCglmm function, MCMCglmm package; [@hadfield2010mcmc]) with a Poisson distribution and log link using 130,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 10, a burnin of 30,000, and minimal priors (V=1, nu=0) [@hadfield2014coursenotes]. We will ensure the GLMM shows acceptable convergence (lag time autocorrelation values <0.01; [@hadfield2010mcmc]), and adjust parameters if necessary to meet this criterion. We will determine whether an independent variable had an effect or not using the Estimate in the full model.

 - **Deviation from the plan:** we added the independent variable, total seconds of observation time, to account for the different amounts of observation time with regard to the number of foods eaten and foraging techniques used per individual.

We will quantify the number of different food types and foraging techniques during focal follows according to the [ethogram](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8wsA3geaRGlMjRxYTRpdG2i5oCXNGq9zBlTnj02Gho/edit?usp=sharing). If a grackle forages during a focal follow we record WHAT it eats, as well as HOW the bird is searching for food. Foraging techniques include: Flipping over objects (flip), digging in ground with bill or feet (dig), sweeping head back and forth [i.e., actually sweeping the bill across the substrate; (sw)], extracting from a substrate (ex), lowers body posture to be parallel to ground to stalk/catch prey from air, from ground, from tree, etc (sc), using gaping bill to search through substrate (ga), lifting or nudging objects with bill (ln). 

#### P1 alternative 2: flexible = more valuable food types

Prediction: If there is a negative correlation between flexibility and the number of different foods eaten, this might indicate that the more flexible individuals target particular food items. If this prediction is supported, we will conduct an additional analysis to examine what food types the more flexible grackles eat and whether these food types are potentially more valuable (measured as having more calories).

**Analysis:** We will rank all food types eaten by the grackles by their caloric value, examine the food types eaten per individual and relate this to their flexibility scores on their most recent reversal learning color tube experiment. This will allow us to see whether the more flexible individuals (faster to reverse) eat more valuable (i.e., higher calorie) food types than the less flexible individuals.

### P2: FLexibility manipulation and foraging behavior 



#### P3: flexible = more human foods

**Analysis:** A GLMM was conducted as in P1-P2, except this GLMM used a binomial distribution (called "categorical" in MCMCglmm) due to the response variable being a proportion.

#### P4: flexible = a greater number of bonds or stronger bonds

**Analysis:** A GLMM was conducted as in P1-P2.

To quantify social relationships, we will conduct at least four 10-minute focal follows on each subject spaced equally across breeding and non-breeding seasons. We will find subjects in the wild because we will attach radio transmitter tags to all grackles that are released from the aviaries upon completion of their test battery. To ensure we fully sample social and foraging behavior, we will prioritize conducting focal follows on these tagged grackles for which we have a much larger amount of individualized data, including multiple measures of flexibility. We will also sample many other color marked grackles that were never tested in the aviaries, and thus do not have measures of flexibility. By conducting focal follows on grackles that were not in captivity, we can verify that the time in captivity had no effect on grackle social behavior after release because aviary-tested birds should be indistinguishable from non-aviary-tested birds in these analyses.

To measure affiliative bonds, during each focal follow we will record when another grackle comes within one body length of the focal bird (and does not engage in aggressive interactions). In case we do not observe enough of these close associations, we will also record when another grackle comes within 3m of the focal subject (and does not engage in aggressive interactions). Finally, we will conduct a scan sample at the end of the follow to determine group size as the number of other grackles within 10m of the focal individual. Unmarked grackles that are seen in proximity of the focal individual will be recorded and included in the count of group size and individual degree (the number of unique associates), but because we cannot distinguish unmarked individuals from each other, we will exclude unmarked bird data from calculations of an individual’s summed bond strengths (see details in the next paragraph).  

We will also measure aggressive behavioral interactions, as indicated in our ethogram. The outcome of these dyadic interactions will be used to create our index of dominance (wins - losses / wins + losses). 

We will conduct subsequent follows on the same individual only when 3 or more weeks have passed since the previous focal follow to prevent temporal autocorrelation in behavior (@whitehead2008analyzing). From the data sheet of dyadic associations during focal follows, we will create a matrix of association strengths between all marked grackles by calculating the Half-Weight association index. This index determines association strength based on the proportion of observations in which two individuals are seen together versus separately, and accounts for bias arising from subjects that are more likely to be observed separately rather than together in the same group (@cairns1987comparison). From the matrix of association values, we will use the R package igraph (@csardi2006igraph) to create a social network, and calculate each individual’s strength (sum of all association values) and degree (maximum number of unique associates) values (@croft2008exploring).

Before analyzing degree and strength, we will determine if these values differ between breeding (Apr - Aug) and non-breeding seasons (Sept - Mar) because social associations could change as a result of breeding behaviors. If there is no difference, we will combine all data for the analyses described below. If there is a difference, we will only use the non-breeding season data.

Social network data are not independent (@croft2011hypothesis), therefore, to determine whether individuals are associating non-randomly based on flexibility (i.e., association strength between two grackles is larger than would be expected by random chance), we will compare our model results to those obtained from random networks. To make a random network, we will use the R package sna (@butts2016sna) and the function “rperm” to randomly rearrange the association strengths (edges) of grackles in our network. We will conduct this edge randomization (called permutation) 10,000 times to create our sample of random networks. We will then re-calculate our dependent variables from the random networks and re-run the same models (as in @croft2011hypothesis and @whitehead2005testing). We will conclude that social bonds are significantly related to flexibility if the coefficients describing the relationship in our observed data are in the top 2.5% and bottom 2.5% of the coefficients resulting from models run on the random networks.

## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 1: interobserver reliability

To be able to conduct focal follows [methods as in @altmann1974observational], a coder must pass interobserver reliability before the data they collect is used in the data set. To pass, coders must have an intra-class correlation [ICC; @hutcheon2010random] of 0.90 or greater based on at least six 10-min focal follows where both coders recorded the behavior of the same focal individual at the same time.

Bergeron was the first person to conduct focal follows, therefore she trained McCune and Folsom until they passed interobserver reliability (on 10 June 2019) for each of the 6 variables listed in the preregistration. In March 2021, Rolls passed interobserver reliability (training with McCune) in the California population.

```{r ior, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis', echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# Inter/intra-rater reliability using Cohen's kappa when the variable is categorical (scale=1+) or intra-class correlation coefficient when the variable is continuous (Mandrekar 2011 J Thoracic Oncology 6(1):6-7 https://doi.org/10.1097/JTO.0b013e318200f983)

# Intra-class correlation / reliability coefficient / the
# degree of bias in the regression slope (Hutcheon et al.
# 2010. Random measurement error and regression dilution bias
# www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2289). 'The ratio of variation
# in error-free (true) X values to the variation in the
# observed error-prone (observed) values is known as the
# reliability coefficient, attenuation factor, or intra-class
# correlation.'

#Cohen's kappa = Good for nominal data (where distance doesn't mean anything; don't use the weighted Kappa bc it is like the ICC) https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/psych/versions/1.9.12.31/topics/cohen.kappa

**Scores for McCune (n=6 focal follows, Bergeron=baseline):**

Different Foods Eaten: ICC = 1.00

Different Foraging Techniques: ICC = 0.97 (95% confidence interval=0.823-1.00)

Number of Affiliative Interactions: ICC = 0.96 (95% confidence interval=0.794-1.00)

Number of Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 1.00 (95% confidence interval=0.986-1.00)

Number of Initiated Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 1.00 (95% confidence interval=0.974-1.00)

Microhabitat: Cohen's unweighted kappa = 1.00

**Scores for Folsom (n=6 focal follows, Bergeron=baseline):**

Different Foods Eaten: ICC = 1.00

Different Foraging Techniques: ICC = 1.00

Number of Affiliative Interactions: ICC = 1.00

Number of Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.96 (95% confidence interval=0.779-0.994)

Number of Initiated Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.94 (95% confidence interval=0.696-0.991)

Microhabitat: Cohen's unweighted kappa = 1.00

NOTE: the ICCs for the variable Different Foods Eaten for these focal follows was originally 0.63 (Folsom) and 0.64 (McCune) because Folsom and McCune recorded a "bug" being eaten while Bergeron recorded no food type because she couldn't identify it to a more specific category. At this point, we decided that we would prefer to enter a general category for food type rather than having no information about what was eaten. Therefore, this data point was removed from the interobserver reliability analysis. This resulted in ICCs of 1.00 for both McCune and Folsom on the Different Foods Eaten variable because they matched Bergeron in the other food type data points.

**Scores for Rolls (n=17 focal follows, McCune=baseline):**

Different Foods Eaten: ICC = 0.92 (95% confidence interval=0.791-0.971)

Different Foraging Techniques: ICC = 0.91 (95% confidence interval=0.758-0.966)

Number of Affiliative Interactions: ICC = 0.90 (95% confidence interval=0.751-0.965)

Number of Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.94 (95% confidence interval=0.830-0.977)

Number of Initiated Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.95 (95% confidence interval=0.874-0.983)

**Unregistered reliability analysis for data entry (Jun 2022):** The focal follow data were transferred from the Prim8 auto-generated data sheets and transcribed (from focals that were recorded using audio files) to two analyzable data sheets (one for social behavior and one for foraging behavior) containing data for all variables in this preregistration. During the data cleaning process, several data entry/transcription errors were found, which prompted us to conduct a reliability analysis on the data. We did not record who the data entry person / transcriber was, so we could not conduct an interoberver analysis. Instead, we conducted an intraobserver reliability analysis. Ten percent (37) of the focal follows (total 367) were randomly selected (using RAND() in MS Excel) and recoded by Christa Rolls in 2022. Rolls recorded for each focal follow whether one or more errors in the original data set were made (1) or not (0), and this vector was compared with a vector from the original data set where the assumption wsa that no errors were made (all data points were 0). The Cohen's kappa between the recoded and the original data set was 0.89 (confidence boundary 0.79-0.99), indicating that the data cleaning process corrected enough errors such that the rest of the data did not need to be recoded.
