### ABSTRACT

This is one of the first studies planned for our long-term research on the role of behavioral flexibility in rapid geographic range expansions. **Project background:** Behavioral flexibility, the ability to change behavior when circumstances change based on learning from previous experience (@mikhalevich_is_2017), is thought to play an important role in a species' ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range (e.g., @lefebvre1997feeding, @griffin2014innovation, @chow2016practice, @sol2000behavioural, @sol2002behavioural, @sol2005big). However, behavioral flexibility is rarely directly tested at the individual level, thus limiting our ability to determine how it relates to other traits (e.g., behavior, invasion success, diet generalism, foraging techniques, foraging innovations, mortality, brain size), which limits the power of predictions about a species' ability to adapt behavior to new environments. We use great-tailed grackles (a bird species) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 140 years (i.e., they increased their nesting range by over 5500% between 1880 and 2000 [@wehtje2003range], [@peer2011invasion]) (Fig. 1). Foraging behavior is considered central to the rapid geographic range expansion of this species and it is thought that they have been so successful by following human urban and agricultural corridors (@wehtje2003range, @peer2011invasion). Therefore, as humans continue to modify landscapes, this increases the amount of suitable grackle habitat. We expect this species to be behaviorally flexible because they are fast at reversal learning (@logan2016behavioral), they often encounter human-made "puzzle boxes" in the wild as they attempt to open packaging to access food when digging through garbage cans and eating at outdoor cafes, and they may track resources across time and space. Results will allow us to determine whether, as predicted by hypotheses and cross-species correlational data, in this expanding species, individual-level variation in flexibility is linked with diet breadth, foraging proficiency, social interactions, habitat use, and movement into new geographic areas. **This investigation**: In this piece of the long-term project, we will assess whether individual performance in experiments that assess behavioral flexibility relates to individual variation in ecological and social behavior in the natural environment. In particular, we aim to determine whether the more behaviorally flexible (measured by reversal learning and solution switching on a multi-access box in a separate [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md)) grackles have more flexible foraging behavior (eat a larger number of different foods, use a wider variety of foraging techniques), are more flexible in their habitat use (are found in more diverse habitat types, disperse farther from their natal area), and are more flexible in their social relationships (have more or stronger social bonds particularly with less related individuals). We will be able to compare the grackle's ability to adapt behavior according to social context with data from other species, as well as determine whether it is linked with measures of flexibility in asocial contexts.  

We present the results from different hypotheses in separate articles: Hypotheses 1 and 2 are in this article, and Hypothesis 3 is in @logan2022flexforaginghabitatuse.

## INTRODUCTION


### HYPOTHESIS

#### H3: Individuals that are [behaviorally flexible](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md) [see @mikhalevich_is_2017 for a detailed definition] will differ in their use of microhabitats within human-modified landscapes (substrate qualification during each focal follow), but the macrohabitat (square kilometer) of each population will not differ in human population density (measured with a GPS point for each focal follow after their release from the aviaries; we measure microhabitat types according to the last substrate the focal individual was seen on at the end of the focal follow: grass, gravel, tree, cement cafe, dumpster, [additional substrates will be added as they are encountered]). Flexibility is measured in aviaries using two paradigms: reversal learning and switching between options on a multi-access box. Although we were only able to find this species in association with human-modified landscapes based on eBird sightings (i.e., there appear to be no forest-based populations), individuals could use these landscapes in a variety of ways. For example, they could specialize on particular foods or at particular types of locations (e.g., foraging exclusively at cafes or in grassy areas), they could generalize across all foods and location types, or they might fall somewhere in between these extremes. 

**P5:** Individuals immigrating into a population are more likely to be flexible, potentially because they need to learn how to obtain resources in an unfamiliar area. Immigrants are individuals who carry many genetic variants (identified using ddRADseq) that are not found in other individuals in this population.

**P5 alternative:** Individuals immigrating into a population are not more likely to be flexible, potentially because the human urban environment is comparable across landscapes. 

**P6:** Flexible individuals will be found more regularly in a wider diversity microhabitats (human-modified substrates including cement, dumpsters or cafes; or natural substrates including grass, shrubs, and trees [additional substrates will be added as they are encountered]) during focal follows.

**P6 alternative:** Flexibility is not associated with presence in diverse microhabitats because the more flexible individuals might specialize in specific foraging strategies best suited to particular microhabitats. 

**P7:** There will be no difference in human population density among the sites for our three grackle populations because all great-tailed grackle populations are highly associated with human-modified landscapes. Human population density per square mile data will be obtained from census information (US census bureau: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/LND110210, still looking for a source for Central American countries)

**P8:** Flexible individuals will not be associated with presence in diverse microhabitats not necessarily because they are specialists or generalists in specific foraging strategies, but rather because they may focus on high quality resources in particular habitat types. If this prediction is supported, we will conduct an additional analysis to examine the proportion of focal follows associated with a particular microhabitat type, which will allow us to determine whether the more flexible individuals are associated with particular microhabitats more than the less flexible individuals.


## METHODS

Please see our preregistration that received in principle acceptance at PCI Ecology [PDF](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/Files/Preregistrations/g_flexforagingPassedPreStudyPeerReviewOn6Aug2019.pdf) for the preregistered methods. We include here a summary of the methods and describe the deviations from the preregistration. We present the results from different hypotheses from the preregistration in two separate articles: Hypotheses 1 and 2 are in this article, and Hypothesis 3 is in @logan2022flexforaginghabitatuse.

### Planned sample and data collection stopping rule

Great-tailed grackles (n > 200) were caught in the wild at three field sites across their geographic range: the center of their original range (at a site to be determined in Central America), the middle of the northward expanding edge (Tempe, Arizona USA), and on the northern expanding edge (Sacramento, California USA). Individuals were identified using colored leg bands in unique combinations, their data collected (blood, feathers, and biometrics), and then they were released back to the wild. Some individuals (64-100, minimum 60) were brought temporarily into aviaries for behavioral testing, and then released back to the wild where the data for this study were collected. We will stop collecting data in April 2023 when the current funding ends, or after data have been collected at all three field sites, whichever date comes first.

 - **Deviation from the plan:** We originally planned to collect data from three field sites: the middle of the northward expanding edge (Tempe, Arizona), on the northern expanding edge (this ended up being in Sacramento, California), and at a site in the center of their original range (Central America). We ended up not being able to run the Central American site because the research station we were planning on using as the base for the site was exposed for having decades of sexual abuse toward women. We did not feel comfortable being at that station or bringing our business there, and it was too late to find another site because they take years to set up. Therefore, we have data only from two field sites and not three. This also means our sample size was not >200 grackles as originally planned. Our sample size ended up being 66 grackles with focal follow data in Arizona and 32 grackles in California, for a total of 98. We had also planned on bringing at least 60 of these grackles into the aviaries for behavioral choice tests. Of the grackles we brought into the aviaries, 49 (20 in Arizona and 19 in California) ended up completing their reversal learning experiment. We stopped collecting data in December 2022 when the California field site's data collection was complete.

#### Open data

The data, scripts, and code are available at the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity's data repository [@logan2022flexforaginghabitatusedata].


#### Dependent variables

***P5: flexible = immigrants***

Probability of being an immigrant (measured using maximum-likelihood-based individual assignment probabilities calculated using an admixture program with the ddRADseq data)

***P6: flexible = wider range of habitats***

Evenness in the proportion of time spent in each habitat type (grass, gravel and other natural substrate, cement, cafe, dumpster)

***P8: flexible = particular habitats***

Proportion of focal follows in each habitat type (grass, gravel and other natural substrate, cement, cafe, dumpster)

#### Independent variables

***P6***

1) Flexibility 1: **Number of trials to reverse** a preference in the last reversal (in the reversal learning experiment) an individual experienced (individuals in the flexibility control group only experience 1 reversal so this data will come from their first and only reversal; individuals in the flexibility manipulation group experience serial reversals until they pass a certain criterion, therefore we will only use data from their most recent reversal). An individual is considered to have a preference if it chose the rewarded option at least 17 out of the most recent 20 trials, with a minimum of 8 or 9 correct choices out of 10 on the two most recent sets of 10 trials). See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md).

2) Flexibility 3: If the number of trials to reverse a preference does not positively correlate with the number of trials to attempt or solve (meet criterion) new loci on the multi-access box (an additional measure of behavioral flexibility), then the **number of trials to solve** and the **number of trials to attempt** a new option on the multi-access box will be additional dependent variables. See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md).

3) Flexibility 4: This measure is currently being developed and is intended be a more accurate representation of all of the choices an individual made, as well as accounting for the degree of uncertainty exhibited by individuals as preferences change. It will be based on a Bayesian estimate of the reduction in error across trials estimated from the number of correct choices from the beginning of each reversal. If this measure more effectively represents flexibility (determined using a modeled dataset and not the actual data), we may decide to solely rely on this measure and not use flexibility measures 1 through 3. If this ends up being the case, we will modify the code in the analysis plan below to reflect this change.

4) Flexibility manipulation: control, manipulated

5) Dominance rank: measured as the number of wins minus the number of losses, divided by the sum of wins + losses. This calculation will give each individual a dominance rank number, and we will order individuals by rank from lowest to highest to create a dominance hierarchy.

6) Condition: aviary-tested, not-aviary-tested

7) ID (random effect because multiple measures per individual)

8) Population: center (Central America), middle (Arizona), edge (northern US) (random effect because each population might have a different slope)

***P5: immigrants = more flexible***

1) Flexibility 1: **Number of trials to reverse** a preference in the last reversal an individual experienced (reversal learning; an individual is considered to have a preference if it chose the rewarded option at least 17 out of the most recent 20 trials, with a minimum of 8 or 9 correct choices out of 10 on the two most recent sets of 10 trials). See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md).

2) Flexibility 3: If the number of trials to reverse a preference does not positively correlate with the latency to attempt or solve new loci on the multi-access box (an additional measure of behavioral flexibility), then the **average latency to solve** and the **average latency to attempt** a new option on the multi-access box will be additional dependent variables. See behavioral flexibility [preregistration](https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/EasyToReadFiles/g_flexmanip.md).

3) Flexibility 4: A Bayesian measure is currently being developed and is intended be a more accurate representation of all of the choices an individual made, as well as accounting for the degree of uncertainty exhibited by individuals as preferences change. If this measure more effectively represents flexibility (determined using a modeled dataset and not the actual data), we may decide to solely rely on this measure and not use flexibility measures 1 through 3. If this ends up being the case, we will modify the code in the analysis plan below to reflect this change.

4) Population: center (Central America), middle (Arizona), edge (northern US) (random effect because each population might have a different slope)

***P8: flexible = particular habitats***

Flexibility 1 (as above)

### E. ANALYSIS PLAN

We do not plan to **exclude** any data. When **missing data** occur, the existing data for that individual will be included in the analyses for the tests they completed. Analyses will be conducted in R (current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam). When there is more than one experimenter within a test, experimenter will be added as a random effect to account for potential differences between experimenters in conducting the tests. If there are no differences between models including or excluding experimenter as a random effect, then we will use the model without this random effect for simplicity.

We will analyze data for females and males separately because each sex has a distinct natural history.

#### Ability to detect actual effects

To begin to understand what kinds of effect sizes we will be able to detect given our sample size limitations and our interest in decreasing noise by attempting to measure it, which increases the number of explanatory variables, we will revise the Analysis Plan after reading @statrethinkingbook. We currently don’t have any estimates for any of our measured variables because these tests have never been done in grackles and we have not encountered previous research that has manipulated flexibility in this way. We will use Bayesian analyses to estimate our likely confidence in the results given simulated data. We will revise this preregistration to include these new analyses before conducting the planned analyses on our actual data. Based on the simulations, we might adapt the number of focal follows per individual or decide to collect much more data just with the aviary-tested birds to increase the amount of information per individual.

#### Data checking

The data will be checked for overdispersion, underdispersion, zero-inflation, and heteroscedasticity with the DHARMa R package [@Hartig2019dharma] following methods by [Hartig](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html). Note: DHARMa doesn't support MCMCglmm, therefore we will use the closest supported model: glmer from the R package lme4 [@lme4].

### P7: no difference in human population density across sites

Human population density (population per square mile) in 2020 was obtained from the US Census Bureau for Tempe, Arizona (4,521.2; https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/tempecityarizona,US/POP060220) and Woodland, California (3,985.1; https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/woodlandcitycalifornia/POP060220). A t-test is used to determine whether there are differences between populations.


## RESULTS

### P5: flexible = immigrants

**Analysis:** Because the independent variables could influence each other, we will analyze them in a single model: Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM; MCMCglmm function, MCMCglmm package; [@hadfield2010mcmc]) with a Poisson distribution and log link using 130,000 iterations with a thinning interval of 10, a burnin of 30,000, and minimal priors (V=1, nu=0) [@hadfield2014coursenotes]. We will ensure the GLMM shows acceptable convergence (lag time autocorrelation values <0.01; [@hadfield2010mcmc]), and adjust parameters if necessary to meet this criterion. We will determine whether an independent variable had an effect or not using the Estimate in the full model.

#### P6: flexible = wider range of habitats

**Analysis:** A GLMM was conducted as in P5.

 - **Deviation from the preregistration:** we originally planned on running models with a Poisson distribution, however MCMCglmm does not allow non-integers and the Shannon Diversity Index is an integer. Therefore, we used the Gaussian distribution and identity link instead.

This species is primarily found within urbanized environments, however there are many different substrates within urban habitats that could provide a variety of food items. Since we are interested in the flexibility of grackle foraging behaviors within the urban habitat, we have focused our habitat diversity measures on the different substrates on which we are mostly likely to see individual variability in foraging behaviors and food types, if present.  For example, cement, cafe, and dumpster substrates are all likely to contain human-provided food (either because people leave food out for wild animals or wild animals are able to scrounge human foods), whereas grass, gravel, or other natural substrates such as trees likely contain non-human provided prey items including insects and small vertebrates. Using the Shannon diversity index to understand the evenness of substrate use within urban habitats has been recommended by others in the field of urban ecology (@alberti2001quantifying & @tews2004animal).

### P7: no difference in human population density across sites

Human population density (population per square mile) in 2020 was significantly higher in Tempe, Arizona (4,521.2) than in Woodland, California (3,985.1) (t-test: t=15.87, df=1, p=0.04).

### P8: flexible = particular habitats

**Analysis:** We examined the proportion of focal follows associated with each microhabitat per individual and related this to their flexibility scores on their most recent reversal learning color tube experiment. This will allow us to see whether the more flexible individuals (faster to reverse) are associated with particular microhabitats more than the less flexible individuals.

```{r p8, eval=FALSE}
p8 <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corinalogan/grackles/master/Files/Preregistrations/g_flexforaging_data_proportionmicrohabitats.csv"), header=T, sep=",", stringsAsFactors=F)
p8 <- data.frame(p8)

#exclude NAs from the Phi column
p8 <- subset(p8, is.na(p8$Phi) == FALSE)

mp8phi <- glmer(Phi ~ ProportionFollows*Microhabitat + (1|ID), family=gaussian, data=p8f)
mp8lambda <- glmer(Lambda ~ ProportionFollows*Microhabitat + (1|ID), family=gaussian, data=p8f)
```


## DISCUSSION

Contrary to our prediction (P7), human population density was higher in Tempe than in Woodland.

## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 1: interobserver reliability

To be able to conduct focal follows [methods as in @altmann1974observational], a coder must pass interobserver reliability before the data they collect is used in the data set. To pass, coders must have an intra-class correlation [ICC; @hutcheon2010random] of 0.90 or greater based on at least six 10-min focal follows where both coders recorded the behavior of the same focal individual at the same time.

Bergeron was the first person to conduct focal follows, therefore she trained McCune and Folsom until they passed interobserver reliability (on 10 June 2019) for each of the 6 variables listed in the preregistration. In March 2021, Rolls passed interobserver reliability (training with McCune) in the California population.

# Inter/intra-rater reliability using Cohen's kappa when the variable is categorical (scale=1+) or intra-class correlation coefficient when the variable is continuous (Mandrekar 2011 J Thoracic Oncology 6(1):6-7 https://doi.org/10.1097/JTO.0b013e318200f983)

**Scores for McCune (n=6 focal follows, Bergeron=baseline):**

Different Foods Eaten: ICC = 1.00

Different Foraging Techniques: ICC = 0.97 (95% confidence interval=0.823-1.00)

Number of Affiliative Interactions: ICC = 0.96 (95% confidence interval=0.794-1.00)

Number of Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 1.00 (95% confidence interval=0.986-1.00)

Number of Initiated Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 1.00 (95% confidence interval=0.974-1.00)

Microhabitat: Cohen's unweighted kappa = 1.00

**Scores for Folsom (n=6 focal follows, Bergeron=baseline):**

Different Foods Eaten: ICC = 1.00

Different Foraging Techniques: ICC = 1.00

Number of Affiliative Interactions: ICC = 1.00

Number of Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.96 (95% confidence interval=0.779-0.994)

Number of Initiated Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.94 (95% confidence interval=0.696-0.991)

Microhabitat: Cohen's unweighted kappa = 1.00

NOTE: the ICCs for the variable Different Foods Eaten for these focal follows was originally 0.63 (Folsom) and 0.64 (McCune) because Folsom and McCune recorded a "bug" being eaten while Bergeron recorded no food type because she couldn't identify it to a more specific category. At this point, we decided that we would prefer to enter a general category for food type rather than having no information about what was eaten. Therefore, this data point was removed from the interobserver reliability analysis. This resulted in ICCs of 1.00 for both McCune and Folsom on the Different Foods Eaten variable because they matched Bergeron in the other food type data points.

**Scores for Rolls (n=17 focal follows, McCune=baseline):**

Different Foods Eaten: ICC = 0.92 (95% confidence interval=0.791-0.971)

Different Foraging Techniques: ICC = 0.91 (95% confidence interval=0.758-0.966)

Number of Affiliative Interactions: ICC = 0.90 (95% confidence interval=0.751-0.965)

Number of Aggressive Interactions: ICC = 0.94 (95% confidence interval=0.830-0.977)

**Unregistered reliability analysis for data entry (Jun 2022):** The focal follow data were transferred from the Prim8 auto-generated data sheets and transcribed (from focals that were recorded using audio files) to two analyzable data sheets (one for social behavior and one for foraging behavior) containing data for all variables in this preregistration. During the data cleaning process, several data entry/transcription errors were found, which prompted us to conduct a reliability analysis on the data. We did not record who the data entry person / transcriber was, so we could not conduct an interoberver analysis. Instead, we conducted an intraobserver reliability analysis. Ten percent (37) of the focal follows (total 367) were randomly selected (using RAND() in MS Excel) and recoded by Christa Rolls in 2022. Rolls recorded for each focal follow whether one or more errors in the original data set were made (1) or not (0), and this vector was compared with a vector from the original data set where the assumption wsa that no errors were made (all data points were 0). The Cohen's kappa between the recoded and the original data set was 0.89 (confidence boundary 0.79-0.99), indicating that the data cleaning process corrected enough errors such that the rest of the data did not need to be recoded.
