Next we put yellow tubes into aviary facing sides (tube not visible; one piece of food visible on top) and he did not participate for 5 minutes, thus timed out. We gave him a break until 10:11. Put yellow tubes back in (tubes not visible, food on top visible) and he did not come down for 3 minutes; at 10:14 moved tubes to face rear of aviaries (tubes visible) and put a 3rd piece of food at the opening of the tube (food visible at opening and on top of yellow tubes). Took tubes away at 10:18. Corina thought because he is a fast working bird, we were just waiting for him to time out and he clearly was not interested in participating. Tried again at 11:02 with 2 yellow tubes (tube and food visible). We added more food on top of tube at 11:05. Added a full cracker between the tubes at 11:07, which he ate. He ate from one tube at 11:08 and then the next. Next we did food and tube visible at 11:12. At 11:15 we put pieces at the front of the tube (food and tube visible). Took away at 11:18. Tried again at 11:40 (tubes visible food visible at front of tube). Added food to top of tubes at 11:44 - he came down and ate all then investigated the tubes until 11:49. Placed again at 11:51 (tube and food visible - ate all from both tubes (2 each). Put again 11:54 tube visible food not visible. Came down right away. 11:57 yellow tube and food not visible. Came down right away. Again 11:59 food and tube not visible. He came down after 3 minutes and ate from within both tubes. Ending on a high note. Oct-01-2019: Goal1 3x tube and food not visible (eat out of both), followed by Boal 23x food and tube not visible but only allowed to eat out of 1 tube although both will have food. Goal1: 10:34 came down within 1 min and ate from both tubes; 10:39 came down within 20 seconds and ate from both tubes; 10:42 came down within 10 seconds ate ate from both tubes; Goal 2: 10:42 good; 10:46; 10:47 good."
