Next we put yellow tubes into aviary facing sides (tube not visible; one piece of food visible on top) and he did not participate for 5 minutes, thus timed out. We gave him a break until 10:11. Put yellow tubes back in (tubes not visible, food on top visible) and he did not come down for 3 minutes; at 10:14 moved tubes to face rear of aviaries (tubes visible) and put a 3rd piece of food at the opening of the tube (food visible at opening and on top of yellow tubes). Took tubes away at 10:18. Corina thought because he is a fast working bird, we were just waiting for him to time out and he clearly was not interested in participating. Tried again at 11:02 with 2 yellow tubes (tube and food visible). We added more food on top of tube at 11:05. Added a full cracker between the tubes at 11:07, which he ate. He ate from one tube at 11:08 and then the next. Next we did food and tube visible at 11:12. At 11:15 we put pieces at the front of the tube (food and tube visible). Took away at 11:18. Tried again at 11:40 (tubes visible food visible at front of tube). Added food to top of tubes at 11:44 - he came down and ate all then investigated the tubes until 11:49. Placed again at 11:51 (tube and food visible - ate all from both tubes (2 each). Put again 11:54 tube visible food not visible. Came down right away. 11:57 yellow tube and food not visible. Came down right away. Again 11:59 food and tube not visible. He came down after 3 minutes and ate from within both tubes. Ending on a high note. Oct-01-2019: Goal1 3x tube and food not visible (eat out of both), followed by Boal 23x food and tube not visible but only allowed to eat out of 1 tube although both will have food. Goal1: 10:34 came down within 1 min and ate from both tubes; 10:39 came down within 20 seconds and ate from both tubes; 10:42 came down within 10 seconds ate ate from both tubes; Goal 2: 10:42 good; 10:46; 10:47 good."

Plan: Start with T15 and proceed using bait as needed (at 5 mins working down to at 3 mins depending on how he's doing - 3 mins if he keeps participating after taking bait); when he stops participating give 20 minute break and start the next session with yellow tubes (tube and food not visible, but both with food; maintain that he can only look in one tube because he learned that lesson yesterday)."
Reversal,Tempe,2-Oct-19,Diablo,12,16,-1,"Baited at 10:25 and he ate the bait and went to his water and then up (did not make a choice). Plan: Wait 20 mins (10:45), then yellow tubes 1-2 times then back to grey tubes. 11:29 he came down immediately and ate from right and tried 3 times to look in left but I 'ah ah ah''d him. 11:33 came down within 1 minute and to right and then tried to look at left and was 'ah ah ah'd and flew up at that. 11:34 came down straight away and ate from right then walked toward left and was ah ah ah'd and he flew up."
Reversal,Tempe,2-Oct-19,Diablo,13,16,0,Note: we switched to have the light grey tube on the right (our right) to help him stay motivated.
Reversal,Tempe,2-Oct-19,Diablo,13,17,-1,"Baited at 5 minutes and the team showed up right then and he started being scared (vocalizing and flying from perch to perch). He came down and ate the bait and did not make a choice (flew to water and then up). Plan wait 20 minutes (12:10) and start with grey tubes, no bait (bait is not working bc he's getting in the habit of just taking the bait and not making a choice)."
Reversal,Tempe,2-Oct-19,Diablo,14,17,0,Came down within 2 minutes
Reversal,Tempe,2-Oct-19,Diablo,14,18,-1,He came down and looked at the sides of the light grey tube but did not look in it. It seemed as though he felt he'd participated and he flew up to his perch after that. 20 minute break (12:41)
