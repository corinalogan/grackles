	abstract = {The Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) seems to take advantage of inhospitable environments such as cities. However, it is not yet fully understood how these birds exploit hostile environments to their advantage. Casual observation seems to suggest that this species can obtain resources of biological importance such as food or nesting material from the trash. As a first approach to the problem, we located a patch outside a residential building, in a high-density urban area, where the residents left their trash for pick-up, and a group of wild Great-tailed grackles was identified as regular visitors. In total, 25 days were recorded at the site (November 2017 - January 2018). Events such as foraging, number of subjects present at the foraging site, aggressive behaviors between members of the group, and their relation with the presence or absence of the garbage collector truck were registered. The results show a higher number of grackles at the observation site and a higher frequency of foraging behaviors in the presence of garbage collection than in its absence. In its presence, the distribution of foraging during the day follows a normal distribution. In the absence, the distribution shows more variability towards the day. The highest frequency of interactions occurred between two grackles, yet there were records of up to eight subjects. The highest number of aggressions registered took place in the absence of garbage collection than in its presence. Moreover, the focal subject exhibits fewer agonistic behaviors compared to other members of the group, a result expected if the producer-scrounger game literature is considered. The outcome is explained in terms of deprivation and availability of resources. Finally, we conclude that grackles can exploit hazardous environments such as cities due to the highly social behaviors exhibited during foraging.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Ecological factors have been shown to be important for brain size evolution. In this comparative study among catarrhine primates, we examine two different ways in which seasonality may be related to brain size. First, seasonality may impose energetic constraints on the brain because it forces animals to deal with periods of food scarcity (Expensive Brain hypothesis). Second, seasonality may act as a selective pressure to increase brain size, as behavioral flexibility helps to overcome periods of food scarcity (Cognitive Buffer hypothesis). Controlling for phylogeny, we found a strong negative relationship between brain size (relative to body mass) and the degree of experienced seasonality, as estimated by the variation in net energy intake. However, we also found a significant positive relationship between relative brain size and the effect of so-called cognitive buffering, proxied by the difference between environmental seasonality and the seasonality in net energy intake actually experienced by the animals. These results show that both energetic constraints of seasonal habitats as well as cognitive buffering affect brain size evolution, leaving environmental seasonality uncorrelated to brain size. With this study we show the importance of simultaneously considering both costs and benefits in models of brain size evolution.},

Although early explanations tended to emphasize the brain's role in sensory or technical competence (foraging skills, innovations, and way-finding), the balance of evidence now clearly favors the suggestion that it was the computational demands of living in large, complex societies that selected for large brains. However, recent analyses suggest that it may have been the particular demands of the more intense forms of pairbonding that was the critical factor that triggered this evolutionary development. This may explain why primate sociality seems to be so different from that found in most other birds and mammals: Primate sociality is based on bonded relationships of a kind that are found only in pairbonds in other taxa.},

This poses a fundamental problem in comparative and computational neuroscience, because small brains are expected to have a lower information-processing capacity. Using the isotropic fractionator to determine numbers of neurons in specific brain regions, here we show that the brains of parrots and songbirds contain on average twice as many neurons as primate brains of the same mass, indicating that avian brains have higher neuron packing densities than mammalian brains. Additionally, corvids and parrots have much higher proportions of brain neurons located in the pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals and birds. Thus, large-brained parrots and corvids have forebrain neuron counts equal to or greater than primates with much larger brains. We suggest that the large numbers of neurons concentrated in high densities in the telencephalon substantially contribute to the neural basis of avian intelligence.},

Prompted by animal caretaker reports that great apes [chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), and orangutans (Pongo abelii)] at Leipzig Zoo occasionally wash their food, we conducted a study of food washing behaviors that consisted of two parts. In the first part we assessed the current distribution of the behavior on the basis of caretaker reports. In the second (experimental) part, we provided subjects individually with a water basin and two types of food (apples and cereal) that was either clean or covered/mixed with sand. We found that subjects of all species (except gorillas) placed apples in the water before consumption, and that they did so more often when the apples were dirty than when they were clean. Several chimpanzees and orangutans also engaged in behaviors resembling wheat placer mining.},

I address these issues by dividing Mayr's work into three careers or phases: 1) Mayr the naturalist/researcher, 2) Mayr the representative of and spokesman for evolutionary biology and systematics, and more recently 3) Mayr the historian and philosopher of biology. If we want to understand the role of the proximate/ultimate distinction in Mayr's more recent career as a philosopher and historian, then it helps to consider hisearlier use of the distinction, in the course of his research, and in his promotion of the professions of evolutionary biology and systematics. I believe that this approach would also shed light on some other important “philosophical” positions that Mayr has defended, including the distinction between “essentialism: and “population thinking.”},

Although these models have proved useful in a variety of contexts, they still do not cover all the scenarios biologists want to examine. For models based on the OU process, model complexity is restricted in current implementations by assuming that the rate of stochastic motion and the strength of selection do not vary among selective regimes. Here, we expand the OU model of adaptive evolution to include models that variously relax the assumption of a constant rate and strength of selection. In its most general form, the methods described here can assign each selective regime a separate trait optimum, a rate of stochastic motion parameter, and a parameter for the strength of selection. We use simulations to show that our models can detect meaningful differences in the evolutionary process, especially with larger sample sizes. We also illustrate our method using an empirical example of genome size evolution within a large flowering plant clade.},

When tested for direction of turning in front of an opaque barrier, or when a dummy predator was used as a target in a detour test,G. holbrookiandG. falcatusshowed similar biases to the right (opaque barrier) and left (predator), thus suggesting that the difference observed when females were used as a target could arise from species differences in the degree of sexual motivation in a novel environment. The two species that showed bias to the right with the females were less likely to exhibit sexual behaviour when placed in a novel environment. Moreover, manipulation of the factors affecting the relative strength of sexual motivation and of fear of a novel environment, such as how long fish were maintained in captivity or in the test apparatus before being tested, caused shifts in the direction of the lateral asymmetries. These results suggest that the presence of functional asymmetries in behaviour could be widespread among vertebrates and that the direction of such asymmetries tends to be strikingly similar in closely related species, thus supporting the hypothesis of an early evolution of laterality in brain and behaviour.},

The presence of general intelligence poses a major evolutionary puzzle, which has led to increased interest in its presence in nonhuman animals. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate this puzzle, and to explore the implications for current theories about the evolution of cognition. We first review domain-general and domain-specific accounts of human cognition in order to situate attempts to identify general intelligence in nonhuman animals. Recent studies are consistent with the presence of general intelligence in mammals (rodents and primates). However, the interpretation of a psychometric g-factor as general intelligence needs to be validated, in particular in primates, and we propose a range of such tests. We then evaluate the implications of general intelligence in nonhuman animals for current theories about its evolution and find support for the cultural intelligence approach, which stresses the critical importance of social inputs during the ontogenetic construction of survival-relevant skills. The presence of general intelligence in nonhumans implies that modular abilities can arise in two ways, primarily through automatic development with fixed content and secondarily through learning and automatization with more variable content. The currently best-supported model, for humans and nonhuman vertebrates alike, thus construes the mind as a mix of skills based on primary and secondary modules. The relative importance of these two components is expected to vary widely among species, and we formulate tests to quantify their strength.},

	abstract = {During the last 50 years, comparative cognition and neurosciences have improved our understanding of animal minds while evolutionary ecology has revealed how selection acts on traits through evolutionary time. We describe how cognition can be subject to natural selection like any other biological trait and how this evolutionary approach can be used to understand the evolution of animal cognition. We recount how comparative and fitness methods have been used to understand the evolution of cognition and outline how these approaches could extend our understanding of cognition. The fitness approach, in particular, offers unprecedented opportunities to study the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in cognition within species and could allow us to investigate both proximate (i.e., neural and developmental) and ultimate (i.e., ecological and evolutionary) underpinnings of animal cognition together. We highlight recent studies that have successfully shown that cognitive traits can be under selection, in particular by linking individual variation in cognition to fitness. To bridge the gap between cognitive variation and fitness consequences and to better understand why and how selection can occur on cognition, we end this review by proposing a more integrative approach to study contemporary selection on cognitive traits combining socio-ecological data, minimally invasive neuroscience methods and measurement of ecologically relevant behaviors linked to fitness. Our overall goal in this review is to build a bridge between cognitive neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists, illustrate how their research could be complementary, and encourage evolutionary ecologists to include explicit attention to cognitive processes in their studies of behavior.},

	abstract = {Harsh environmental conditions may produce strong selection pressure on traits, such as memory, that may enhance fitness. Enhanced memory may be crucial for survival in animals that use memory to find food and, thus, particularly important in environments where food sources may be unpredictable. For example, animals that cache and later retrieve their food may exhibit enhanced spatial memory in harsh environments compared with those in mild environments. One way that selection may enhance memory is via the hippocampus, a brain region involved in spatial memory. In a previous study, we established a positive relationship between environmental severity and hippocampal morphology in food-caching black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). Here, we expanded upon this previous work to investigate the relationship between environmental harshness and neurogenesis, a process that may support hippocampal cytoarchitecture. We report a significant and positive relationship between the degree of environmental harshness across several populations over a large geographic area and (1) the total number of immature hippocampal neurons, (2) the number of immature neurons relative to the hippocampal volume, and (3) the number of immature neurons relative to the total number of hippocampal neurons. Our results suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis may play an important role in environments where increased reliance on memory for cache recovery is critical. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many insects, however, demonstrate that highly differentiated motor repertoires, extensive social structures and cognition are possible with very small brains, emphasising that we need to understand the neural circuits, not just the size of brain regions, which underlie these feats. Neural network analyses show that cognitive features found in insects, such as numerosity, attention and categorisation-like processes, may require only very limited neuron numbers. Thus, brain size may have less of a relationship with behavioural repertoire and cognitive capacity than generally assumed, prompting the question of what large brains are for. Larger brains are, at least partly, a consequence of larger neurons that are necessary in large animals due to basic biophysical constraints. They also contain greater replication of neuronal circuits, adding precision to sensory processes, detail to perception, more parallel processing and enlarged storage capacity. Yet, these advantages are unlikely to produce the qualitative shifts in behaviour that are often assumed to accompany increased brain size. Instead, modularity and interconnectivity may be more important.},

This special feature of Proceedings of the Royal Society B contains an idiosyncratic range of current research perspectives on neural underpinnings and adaptive benefits (and costs) of such diverse phenomena as spatial memory, colour vision, attention, spontaneous behaviour initiation, memory dynamics, relational rule learning and sleep, in a range of animals from marine invertebrates with exquisitely simple nervous systems to social insects forming societies with many thousands of individuals working together as a ‘superorganism’. This introduction provides context and history to tie the various approaches together, and concludes that there is an urgent need to understand the full neuron-to-neuron circuitry underlying various forms of information processing—not just to explore brain function comprehensively, but also to understand how (and how easily) cognitive capacities might evolve in the face of pertinent selection pressures. In the invertebrates, reaching these goals is becoming increasingly realistic.},

The same overt cognitive capacity might be mediated by entirely different neural circuitries in different species, with a many-to-one mapping between behavioural routines, computations and their neural implementations. Comparative behavioural research needs to be complemented with a bottom-up approach in which neurobiological and molecular-genetic analyses allow pinpointing of underlying neural and genetic bases that constrain cognitive variation. Often, only very minor differences in circuitry might be needed to generate major shifts in cognitive functions and the possibility that cognitive traits arise by convergence or parallel evolution needs to be taken seriously. Hereditary variation in cognitive traits between individuals of a species might be extensive, and selection experiments on cognitive traits might be a useful avenue to explore how rapidly changes in cognitive abilities occur in the face of pertinent selection pressures.},

At the behavioral level, New Caledonian crows stand out amongst corvids because of their impressive object manipulation skills both in the wild and in the laboratory. However, nothing is known about the relative size of their brains. Here we show that NC crows have highly encephalised brains relative to most other birds that have been studied. We compared the relative brain size of five NC crows with combined data for four passerine species (7 European carrion crows, 2 European magpies, 3 European jays and 4 domestic sparrows) and found that NC crows had significantly larger brains. A comparison only with the seven carrion crows also revealed significantly larger brains for NC crows. When compared with brain data for 140 avian species from the literature, the NC crow had one of the highest degrees of encephalisation, exceeding that of the 7 other Corvidae in the data set.},

Here we show that search-image use assists E. culicivora in finding prey and mates when restricted to using olfaction alone. After being primed with prey odour or mate odour (control: not primed with odour), spiders were transferred to an olfactometer designed to test ability to find a prey-odour or mate-odour source that was either ‘cryptic’ (i.e. accompanied by a masking odour source, Lantana camara) or ‘conspicuous’ (no L. camara odour). When tested with conspicuous odour, the identity of the priming odour had no significant effect on how many spiders found the odour source.

One of this predator’s tactics is to launch opportunistic leaping attacks on to other spiders in their webs. Focussing on this particular tactic, our experiments began with a test spider on a ramp facing a lure (dead prey spider mounted on a cork disc) that could be reached by leaping. After the test spider faced the lure for 30 s, we blocked the test spider’s view of the lure by lowering an opaque shutter before the spider leapt. When the shutter was raised 90 s later, either the same lure came into view again (control) or a different lure came into view (experimental: different prey type in same orientation or same prey type in different orientation). We recorded attack frequency (number of test spiders that leapt at the lure) and attack latency (time elapsing between shutter being raised and spiders initiating a leap). Attack latencies in control trials were not significantly different from attack latencies in experimental trials, regardless of whether it was prey type or prey orientation that changed in the experimental trials. However, compared with test spiders in the no-change control trials, significantly fewer test spiders leapt when prey type changed. There was no significant effect on attack frequency when prey orientation changed. These findings suggest that this predator represents prey type independently of prey orientation.},

The distance between the tower and the boxes was too far to reach by leaping and the tower sat on a platform surrounded by water. As the species studied are known to avoid water, the only way they could reach the prey without getting wet was by taking one of two circuitous walkways from the platform: one leading to the prey (‘correct’) and one not leading to the prey (‘incorrect’). After leaving the tower, the test subject could not see the prey and sometimes it had to walk past the incorrect walkway before reaching the correct walkway. Yet all 15 species chose the correct walkway significantly more often than the incorrect walkway. We propose that these findings exemplify genuine cognition based on representation.},

In our experiments, we relied on this predator's known capacity to gain access to prey by following pre-planned detours. After Portia first viewed a scene consisting of a particular number of prey items, it could then take a detour during which the scene went out of view. Upon reaching a tower at the end of the detour, Portia could again view a scene, but now the number of prey items might be different. We found that, compared with control trials in which the number was the same as before, Portia's behaviour was significantly different in most instances when we made the following changes in number: 1 versus 2, 1 versus 3, 1 versus 4, 2 versus 3, 2 versus 4 or 2 versus 6. These effects were independent of whether the larger number was seen first or second. No significant effects were evident when the number of prey changed between 3 versus 4 or 3 versus 6. When we changed prey size and arrangement while keeping prey number constant, no significant effects were detected. Our findings suggest that Portia represents 1 and 2 as discrete number categories, but categorizes 3 or more as a single category that we call ‘many’.},

Biologists call on homology and homoplasy to infer character states, support adaptationist explanations, identify evolutionary novelties and hypothesize phylogenetic relationships. In these contexts, the concepts must be understood phylogenetically and kept separate: as they play divergent roles, overlap between the two ought to be avoided. I use these considerations to criticize an otherwise attractive view defended by Gould, Hall, and Ramsey \& Peterson. By this view, homology and homoplasy can only be delineated qua some level of description, and some homoplasies (parallelisms) are counted as homologous. I develop an account which retains the first, but rejects the second, aspect of that view. I then characterize parallelisms and convergences in terms of their causal role. By the Strict Continuity account, homology and homoplasy are defined phylogenetically and without overlaps, meeting my restriction. Convergence and parallelisms are defined as two types of homoplasy: convergent homoplasies are largely constrained by external factors, while parallelisms are due to internal constraints.},

The distance to the food reward is varied frequently and randomly, whilst keeping the number of intervening landmarks constant. Thus, the bees cannot identify the food reward in terms of its distance from the hive. We find that bees can count up to four objects, when they are encountered sequentially during flight. Furthermore, bees trained in this way are able count novel objects, which they have never previously encountered, thus demonstrating that they are capable of object-independent counting. A further experiment reveals that the counting ability that the bees display in our experiments is primarily sequential in nature. It appears that bees can navigate to food sources by maintaining a running count of prominent landmarks that are passed en route, provided this number does not exceed four.},

We show that body size, basal metabolic rate and life history act as constraints on brain evolution and through this influence the coevolution of neocortex size and group size. However, they do not determine either of these variables, which appear to be locked in a tight coevolutionary system. We show that, within primates, this relationship is specific to the neocortex. Nonetheless, there are important constraints on brain evolution; we use path analysis to show that, in order to evolve a large neocortex, a species must first evolve a large brain to support that neocortex and this in turn requires adjustments in diet (to provide the energy needed) and life history (to allow sufficient time both for brain growth and for ‘software’ programming). We review a wider literature demonstrating a tight coevolutionary relationship between brain size and sociality in a range of mammalian taxa, but emphasize that the social brain hypothesis is not about the relationship between brain/neocortex size and group size per se; rather, it is about social complexity and we adduce evidence to support this. Finally, we consider the wider issue of how mammalian (and primate) brains evolve in order to localize the social effects.},

There is also a significant correlation in haplorhine primates between brain weight and female age at first reproduction. For strepsirhine primates (lorises and lemurs), there are no significant correlations between brain weight and either life-span or female reproductive age when the effect of body size is removed. This lack of correlation in strepsirhine primates may be related to the fact that these primates are nocturnal and/or natives of the island of Madagascar, both of which conditions may reduce competition for resources and predation pressure. These findings suggest that in haplorhine primates the genetic systems controlling brain growth are linked to the systems governing the life cycle so that species with longer cycles have larger brains. When the effect of body weight is removed, leaf-eating haplorhines have significantly smaller brains and shorter lives than haplorhines with other diets. Harem-living haplorhines also have significantly smaller brains and shorter life-spans than troop-living haplorhines when the effect of body weight is removed. We also sought to test the rate-of-living hypothesis by determining whether primates with basal metabolic rates that are higher than would be expected for their body size have shorter maximum life-spans than would be expected for their body size.

We found a hemispheric bias for processing meaningful words, independently of intonation; an auditory brain region for distinguishing intonationally marked and unmarked words; and increased activity in primary reward regions only when both lexical and intonational information were consistent with praise.

ABSTRACT={Invasive species are a global conservation problem that have an enormous economic cost. Understanding the attributes of invasive species and what makes them successful at colonizing and flourishing in novel environments is therefore essential for preventing and ameliorating their negative impact. Learning ability and behavioral flexibility—the ability to adjust behavior flexibly when conditions change including to learn to solve novel problems or existing problems in a novel way, are thought to play a key role during invasions although cognitive ability is rarely considered in studies of invasive species. We begin by reviewing the evidence that flexible learning and problem solving can influence invasion success in both invertebrates and vertebrates. We also review brain size as an index of cognitive ability with respect to invasion success. We then focus on the specific attributes of cognition that are likely to be important for species entering novel environments as they learn the location of resources (e.g., food, shelter), and as they encounter and interact with conspecifics, heterospecifics, and potential predators. We suggest that enhanced spatial learning ability in conjunction with behavioral flexibility are likely to be adaptive. Furthermore, good memory retention and the ability to learn from others (both conspecifics and heterospecifics) are beneficial. Finally, we suggest future directions for studying the link between cognition, fitness, and invasion success. Studies of closely related “invasive” and “non-invasive” species, as well as invasive populations and their source, should provide important baseline information about the potential role of cognitive ability in determining invasion success. We also advocate an experimental approach. In particular, we borrow methods from experimental evolutionary ecology. We suggest that experimental studies in which potential invasive species can be assayed for behavior and their cognitive ability measured prior to population-level release on small islands will help inform us about the potential role of cognitive ability in determining the fitness of invasive species. The idea that cognitive ability may determine invasion success is only now starting to gain traction. This is a rich field worthy of further study that will help us better understand what makes a successful invasive species.}

	abstract = {Parrots and corvids show outstanding innovative and flexible behaviour. In particular, kea and New Caledonian crows are often singled out as being exceptionally sophisticated in physical cognition, so that comparing them in this respect is particularly interesting. However, comparing cognitive mechanisms among species requires consideration of non-cognitive behavioural propensities and morphological characteristics evolved from different ancestry and adapted to fit different ecological niches. We used a novel experimental approach based on a Multi-Access-Box (MAB). Food could be extracted by four different techniques, two of them involving tools. Initially all four options were available to the subjects. Once they reached criterion for mastering one option, this task was blocked, until the subjects became proficient in another solution. The exploratory behaviour differed considerably. Only one (of six) kea and one (of five) NCC mastered all four options, including a first report of innovative stick tool use in kea. The crows were more efficient in using the stick tool, the kea the ball tool. The kea were haptically more explorative than the NCC, discovered two or three solutions within the first ten trials (against a mean of 0.75 discoveries by the crows) and switched more quickly to new solutions when the previous one was blocked. Differences in exploration technique, neophobia and object manipulation are likely to explain differential performance across the set of tasks. Our study further underlines the need to use a diversity of tasks when comparing cognitive traits between members of different species. Extension of a similar method to other taxa could help developing a comparative cognition research program.},

It might therefore be expected that natural selection on particular behavioural capacities would have caused size changes selectively, in the systems mediating those capacities. It has been claimed, however, that developmental constraints limited such mosaic evolution, causing co-ordinated size change among individual brain components. Here we analyse comparative data to demonstrate that mosaic change has been an important factor in brain structure evolution. First, the neocortex shows about a fivefold difference in volume between primates and insectivores even after accounting for its scaling relationship with the rest of the brain. Second, brain structures with major anatomical and functional links evolved together independently of evolutionary change in other structures. This is true at the level of both basic brain subdivisions and more fine-grained functional systems. Hence, brain evolution in these groups involved complex relationships among individual brain components.},

Here we show that two sister species of mice, Peromyscus polionotus and Peromyscus maniculatus, have large and heritable differences in parental behaviour. Using quantitative genetics, we identify 12 genomic regions that affect parental care, 8 of which have sex-specific effects, suggesting that parental care can evolve independently in males and females. Furthermore, some regions affect parental care broadly, whereas others affect specific behaviours, such as nest building. Of the genes linked to differences in nest-building behaviour, vasopressin is differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of the two species, with increased levels associated with less nest building. Using pharmacology in Peromyscus and chemogenetics in Mus, we show that vasopressin inhibits nest building but not other parental behaviours. Together, our results indicate that variation in an ancient neuropeptide contributes to interspecific differences in parental care.

Here we examine innovative problem solving by spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in their natural habitat, and demonstrate for the first time in a non-human animal that those individuals exhibiting a greater diversity of initial exploratory behaviours are more successful problem solvers. Additionally, as in earlier work, we found that neophobia was a critical inhibitor of problem-solving success. Interestingly, although juveniles and adults were equally successful in solving the problem, juveniles were significantly more diverse in their initial exploratory behaviours, more persistent and less neophobic than were adults. We found no significant effects of social rank or sex on success, the diversity of initial exploratory behaviours, behavioural persistence or neophobia. Our results suggest that the diversity of initial exploratory behaviours, akin to some measures of human creativity, is an important, but largely overlooked, determinant of problem-solving success in non-human animals.},

Recently, several comparative studies have revealed correlations between brain size and traits thought to require advanced cognitive abilities, such as innovation, behavioral flexibility, invasion success, and self-control. However, the general assumption that animals with larger brains have superior cognitive abilities has been heavily criticized, primarily because of the lack of experimental support for it. Here, we designed an experiment to inquire whether specific neuroanatomical or socioecological measures predict success at solving a novel technical problem among species in the mammalian order Carnivora. We presented puzzle boxes, baited with food and scaled to accommodate body size, to members of 39 carnivore species from nine families housed in multiple North American zoos. We found that species with larger brains relative to their body mass were more successful at opening the boxes. In a subset of species, we also used virtual brain endocasts to measure volumes of four gross brain regions and show that some of these regions improve model prediction of success at opening the boxes when included with total brain size and body mass. Socioecological variables, including measures of social complexity and manual dexterity, failed to predict success at opening the boxes. Our results, thus, fail to support the social brain hypothesis but provide important empirical support for the relationship between relative brain size and the ability to solve this novel technical problem.},

Human studies have revealed that experiences of maltreatment and neglect during infancy and childhood can have detrimental effects on brain development and cognition. In this study, we evaluated the effects of early rearing experience on brain morphology in 92 captive chimpanzees (ages 11–43) who were either reared by their mothers (n = 46) or in a nursery (n = 46) with age-group peers. Magnetic resonance brain images were analyzed with a processing program (BrainVISA) that extracts cortical sulci. We obtained various measurements from 11 sulci located throughout the brain, as well as whole brain gyrification and white and grey matter volumes. We found that mother-reared chimpanzees have greater global white-to-grey matter volume, more cortical folding and thinner grey matter within the cortical folds than nursery-reared animals. The findings reported here are the first to demonstrate that differences in early rearing conditions have significant consequences on brain morphology in chimpanzees and suggests potential differences in the development of white matter expansion and myelination.},

Comparative studies show that across bird species, performance on different cognitive tasks is usually positively correlated. If the same holds true within species, then the complexity of a male’s learned song ought to be correlated with other cognitive abilities. To test this hypothesis, we measured correlations between song repertoire size and cognitive performance in wild song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. Females prefer males with larger song repertoires in this species, and song repertoire size correlates with various fitness measures. We recorded males’ song repertoires in the field and tested these males in captivity on motor, colour association and reversal learning tasks, as well as on a detour-reaching task that measures inhibitory control. We found that individuals’ performance on the colour association task correlated positively with their performance on the reversal task, but performance did not correlate across the other learning tasks. Males with larger song repertoires were faster to solve the detour-reaching task, but performed worse on the reversal task than males with smaller song repertoires. Although our results suggest that song repertoire size does correlate with one measure of cognitive performance, more detailed song analyses and further cognitive tests are required to answer the questions raised by our findings.},

However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

First, within each of nine experimental paradigms with interspecific variation, we grouped studies by their procedures and the characteristics of their study subjects. Then, using Bayesian latent variable methods, we tested whether taxonomic differences consistently held within or across paradigms. No genus performed especially well within particular paradigms, but genera differed significantly in overall performance. In addition, there was evidence of variation at higher taxonomic levels; most notably, great apes significantly outperformed other lineages. These results cannot be readily explained by perceptual biases or any other contextual confound and instead suggest that primate taxa differ in some kind of domain-general ability.},

* A higher feeding innovation rate has previously been reported in habitat generalist birds from North America. By allowing them to exploit new resources, this higher feeding innovation rate might explain the generalists' advantage. This result might be due to generalists being more likely to find new resources because they are exposed to more diverse environmental conditions. Alternatively, they might differ from specialists in other traits, in particular cognitive skills that might allow them to innovate more complex food searching and handling techniques.


* To test these hypotheses, we separated avian feeding innovations into a ‘technical’ (novel searching and handling behaviour) and a ‘food type’ (incorporation of a new food in a species' diet) category. Technical innovations, but not food type innovations, have previously been shown to correlate with avian brain size, suggesting they reflect cognitive ability. We used a world-wide data base of 2339 feeding innovations recorded in the literature, covering a total of 765 avian species and assessed the correlations between brain size and feeding innovation rates on one side and habitat and diet generalism on the other.


* Habitat generalism was positively related with food type innovation rate, but not technical innovation rate or brain size. This suggests that habitat generalist species are more likely to incorporate new food types in their diet because of higher chances to find new food resources in their environment, or of a higher opportunism, but not enhanced cognitive skills. In contrast, diet generalist species had higher food type and technical innovation rates, as well as larger brains, suggesting that cognitive skills might help species expand their diet breadth or that an increase in diet breadth might favour the evolution of enhanced cognitive abilities.


* Our results provide new insights into the nature of the generalists' advantage in the face of environmental changes, and suggest that dietary and habitat generalism are different, but convergent, routes to feeding flexibility and adaptation to changed environments.},

The volumes of brain and brain structures in rock doves, domestic and urban pigeons were determined from frontal serial sections. By means of allometric methods a total reduction of the brain by 6.86\% were examined for domestic and urban pigeons. This reduction is composed of differently dimensioned changes of brain subdivisions: medulla oblongata 1.94\%, cerebellum 3.76\%, mesencephalon 9.43\%, diencephalon 10.38\% and telencephalon 7.05\%. The highest decrease was found in the hyperstriatum ventrale (12.21\%) and optic tectum (12.05\%), the lowest in the olfactoric structures (0.59\%). Increase in volume was observed in the palaeostriatal complex (2.78\%).Changes in brain size in domestic birds were compared with observations in domestic mammals, and were discussed as due to the environmental changes in domestication and according to cephalization.

Biological invaders can threaten native ecosystems and global biodiversity; they can incur massive economic costs and even introduce diseases. Invasion biologists generally agree that being able to predict when and where an invasion will occur is essential for progress in their field. However, successful predictions of this type remain elusive. This has caused a rift, as some researchers are pessimistic and believe that invasion biology has no future, whereas others are more optimistic and believe that the key to successful prediction is the creation of a general, unified theoretical framework which encompasses all invasion events. Although I agree that there is a future for invasion biology, extensive synthesis is not the way to better predictions. I argue that the causes of invasion phenomena are exceedingly complex and heterogeneous, hence it is impossible to make generalizations over particular events without sacrificing causal detail. However, this causal detail is just what is needed for the specific predictions which the scientists wish to produce. Instead, I show that a limited type of synthesis (integration of data and methods) is a more useful tool for generating successful predictions. An important implication of my view is that it points to a more pluralistic approach to invasion biology, where generalization and prediction are treated as important yet distinct research goals.},

Although there are vast morphological differences between the two groups, there is growing evidence of strong similarities in their mental abilities, particularly in the realm of advanced cognitive processing. This suggestion is initially surprising considering the vast difference between the size and structure of avian and primate brains. Even more surprising is the fact that a number of recent experiments have failed to demonstrate some complex cognitive abilities in primates (including chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans) that have been convincingly demonstrated in some species of birds, such as the corvids (jays, crows, ravens, and magpies) and parrots.},

The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

	abstract = {Three experiments were designed to test whether adult pet dogs are able to show inferential reasoning when searching for their toy in a series of two-way choice tasks. The experimenter placed a toy under one of two identical containers and then provided some information by manipulating the covers: either both containers were lifted or just the empty or baited one. There were other trials when the experimenter not only revealed the corresponding container but manipulated also the other one without showing its content. In the second experiment the same conditions were used except that the content of the containers was revealed by strings without any human manipulation. Results of the two studies show that dogs are able to use inferential reasoning by exclusion (i.e. they can find the hidden toy if they have seen where the toy was missing). However, dogs were able to solve the reasoning task only when they could not rely on social-communicative cues (directional gesture and gaze cues) or could not use any other simple discriminative stimuli (movement of a container) for making decisions. This suggests that dogs are often prevented from showing reasoning abilities by pre-existing biases for social or movement cues. Results of the third experiment also support the primary importance of social cueing because in another object-choice task, individuals preferred to choose the ‘socially marked’ container (touching, gaze alternation) to the remotely moved one when they had no visual information about the location of the toy.},

In insects, higher brain centres called mushroom bodies are enlarged and morphologically elaborate (having doubled, invaginated and subcompartmentalized calyces that receive visual input) in social species such as the ants, bees and wasps of the aculeate Hymenoptera, suggesting that the social brain hypothesis may also apply to invertebrate animals. In a quantitative and qualitative survey of mushroom body morphology across the Hymenoptera, we demonstrate that large, elaborate mushroom bodies arose concurrent with the acquisition of a parasitoid mode of life at the base of the Euhymenopteran (Orussioidea + Apocrita) lineage, approximately 90 Myr before the evolution of sociality in the Aculeata. Thus, sociality could not have driven mushroom body elaboration in the Hymenoptera. Rather, we propose that the cognitive demands of host-finding behaviour in parasitoids, particularly the capacity for associative and spatial learning, drove the acquisition of this evolutionarily novel mushroom body architecture. These neurobehavioural modifications may have served as pre-adaptations for central place foraging, a spatial learning-intensive behaviour that is widespread across the Aculeata and may have contributed to the multiple acquisitions of sociality in this taxon.},

Here, we examine the patterns of selection on male and female brain size in pinnipeds, a group where the strength of sexual selection differs markedly among species and between the sexes. Relative brain size was negatively associated with the intensity of sexual selection in males but not females. However, analyses of the rates of body and brain size evolution showed that this apparent trade-off between sexual selection and brain mass is driven by selection for increasing body mass rather than by an actual reduction in male brain size. Our results suggest that sexual selection has important effects on the allometric relationships of neural development.},

Over the past two decades, comparative biological analyses have undergone profound changes with the incorporation of rigorous evolutionary perspectives and phylogenetic information. This change followed in large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in fact biological groups such as species are differentially related to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated into `the comparative method', and applied to many physiological, biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form and function.},

	abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

Enlarged brains are metabolically expensive and require elongated developmental periods, and so natural selection should have favoured their evolution only if they provide counterbalancing advantages. One possible advantage is facilitating the construction of behavioural responses to unusual, novel or complex socio-ecological challenges. This buffer effect should increase survival rates and favour a longer reproductive life, thereby compensating for the costs of delayed reproduction. Here, using a global database of 493 species, we provide evidence showing that mammals with enlarged brains (relative to their body size) live longer and have a longer reproductive lifespan. Our analysis supports and extends previous findings, accounting for the possible confounding effects of other life history traits, ecological and dietary factors, and phylogenetic autocorrelation. Thus, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that mammals counterbalance the costs of affording large brains with a longer reproductive life.},

The phylogenetic comparative approach is a very powerful one since it combines a large number of species and thus spans long periods of evolutionary change. However, there are limits to the inferences that can be drawn from the results, in part due to the limitations of the most commonly employed analytical methods. In this chapter, we show how confirmatory path analysis can be undertaken explicitly controlling for non-independence due to shared ancestry. The phylogenetic path analysis method we present allows researchers to move beyond the estimation of direct effects and analyze the relative importance of alternative causal models including direct and indirect paths of influence among variables. We begin the chapter with a general introduction to path analysis and then present a step-by-step guide to phylogenetic path analysis using the d-separation method. We also show how the known statistical problems associated with non-independence of data points due to shared ancestry become compounded in path analysis. We finish with a discussion about the potential effects of collinearity and measurement error, and a look toward possible future developments.},

Here, we use comparative analyses of the Tanganyikan cichlid adaptive radiation to investigate the patterns of evolution for brain size and body size separately. We found that body size exhibited recent bursts of rapid evolution, a pattern that is consistent with divergence linked to ecological specialization. Brain weight on the other hand, showed no bursts of divergence but rather evolved in a gradual manner. Our results thus show that even highly genetically correlated traits can present markedly different patterns of evolution, hence interpreting patterns of evolution of traits from correlations in extant taxa can be misleading. Furthermore, our results suggest, contrary to expectations from theory, that brain size does not play a key role during adaptive radiation.},

What emerged was the idea that a succession of distinct human races, which were identified using techniques such as craniometry, had occupied and migrated into Europe beginning in the Ice Age and continuing into the historic period. This marks a phase in the history of human palaeontology that gradually gave way to a science of palaeoanthropology that viewed hominid fossils more from the perspective of evolutionary theory and hominid phylogeny.},

Although descriptions of striking diversity in animal behavior are plentiful, little is known about the mechanisms by which behaviors change and evolve between groups. To fully understand behavioral evolution, it will be necessary to identify the genetic mechanisms that mediate behavioral change in a natural context [1–3]. Genetic analysis of behavior can also reveal associations between behavior and morphological or neural phenotypes, providing insight into the proximate mechanisms that control behavior. Relatively few studies to date have successfully identified genes or genomic regions that contribute to behavioral variation among natural populations or species [2], particularly in vertebrates [4–8]. Here, we apply genetic approaches to dissect a complex social behavior that has long fascinated biologists, schooling behavior [9–13]. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of schooling in an F2 intercross between strongly schooling marine and weakly schooling benthic sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and found that distinct genetic modules control different aspects of schooling behavior. Two key components of the behavior, tendency to school and body position when schooling, are uncorrelated in hybrids and map to different genomic regions. Our results further point to a genetic link between one behavioral component, schooling position, and variation in the neurosensory lateral line.},

	abstract = {In spite of considerable technical advance in MRI techniques, the optical resolution of these methods are still limited. Consequently, the delineation of cytoarchitectonic fields based on probabilistic maps and brain volume changes, as well as small-scale changes seen in MRI scans need to be verified by neuronanatomical/neuropathological diagnostic tools. To attend the current interdisciplinary needs of the scientific community, brain banks have to broaden their scope in order to provide high quality tissue suitable for neuroimaging- neuropathology/anatomy correlation studies. The Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Research Group (BBBABSG) of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School (USPMS) collaborates with researchers interested in neuroimaging-neuropathological correlation studies providing brains submitted to postmortem MRI in-situ. In this paper we describe and discuss the parameters established by the BBBABSG to select and to handle brains for fine-scale neuroimaging-neuropathological correlation studies, and to exclude inappropriate/unsuitable autopsy brains. We tried to assess the impact of the postmortem time and storage of the corpse on the quality of the MRI scans and to establish fixation protocols that are the most appropriate to these correlation studies. After investigation of a total of 36 brains, postmortem interval and low body temperature proved to be the main factors determining the quality of routine MRI protocols. Perfusion fixation of the brains after autopsy by mannitol 20\% followed by formalin 20\% was the best method for preserving the original brain shape and volume, and for allowing further routine and immunohistochemical staining. Taken to together, these parameters offer a methodological progress in screening and processing of human postmortem tissue in order to guarantee high quality material for unbiased correlation studies and to avoid expenditures by post-imaging analyses and histological processing of brain tissue.},

This is the first time functional connectivity measurements are performed in a non-mammalian species. Since the visual system of pigeons is a well-known model for brain asymmetry, the focus of the study was on the neural substrate of the visual system. For fMRI a visual stimulus was used and functional connectivity measurements were done with the entopallium (E; analog for the primary visual cortex) as a seed region. Interestingly in awake pigeons the left E was significantly functionally connected to the right E. Moreover we compared connectivity maps for a seed region in both hemispheres resulting in a stronger bilateral connectivity starting from left E then from right E. These results could be used as a starting point for further imaging studies in awake birds and also provide a new window into the analysis of hemispheric dominance in the pigeon.},

Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for \&gt;10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

However, comparisons among mammals with matched brain weights often reveal greater differences in brain part size, arguing against strong developmental constraints. Here, we test these hypotheses using a quantitative genetic approach involving over 10,000 mice. We identify independent loci for size variation in seven key parts of the brain, and observe that brain parts show low or no phenotypic correlation, as is predicted by a mosaic scenario. We also demonstrate that variation in brain size is independently regulated from body size. The allometric relations seen at higher phylogenetic levels are thus unlikely to be the product of strong developmental constraints.},

Homology similarity because of common descent and ancestry, homoplasy is similarity arrived at via independent evolution However, given that there is but one tree of life, all organisms, and therefore all features of organisms, share degree of relationship and similarity one to another. That sharing may be similarity or even identity of structure the sharing of a most recent common ancestor–as in the homology of the arms of humans and apes–or it reflect some (often small) degree of similarity, such as that between the wings of insects and the wings of groups whose shared ancestor lies deep within the evolutionary history of the Metazoa. It may reflect sharing entire developmental pathways, partial sharing, or divergent pathways. This review compares features classified homologous with the classes of features normally grouped as homoplastic, the latter being convergence, parallelism, reversals, rudiments, vestiges, and atavisms. On the one hand, developmental mechanisms may be conserved, when a complete structure does not form (rudiments, vestiges), or when a structure appears only in some individuals (atavisms). On the other hand, different developmental mechanisms can produce similar (homologous) features Joint examination of nearness of relationship and degree of shared development reveals a continuum within expanded category of homology, extending from homology → reversals → rudiments → vestiges → atavisms → parallelism, with convergence as the only class of homoplasy, an idea that turns out to be surprisingly old. realignment provides a glimmer of a way to bridge phylogenetic and developmental approaches to homology homoplasy, a bridge that should provide a key pillar for evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). It will and in a practical sense cannot, alter how homoplastic features are identified in phylogenetic analyses. But rudiments, reversals, vestiges, atavisms and parallelism as closer to homology than to homoplasy should guide toward searching for the common elements underlying the formation of the phenotype (what some have called deep homology of genetic and/or cellular mechanisms), rather than discussing features in terms of shared independent evolution.},

As a consequence, any sexually motivated approach carries a risk of ending up as prey rather than as a mate. Sexual selection has shaped courtship to effectively communicate the presence, identity, motivation and/or quality of potential mates, which help ameliorate these risks. Spiders communicate this information via several sensory channels, including mechanical (e.g. vibrational), visual and/or chemical, with examples of multimodal signalling beginning to emerge in the literature. The diverse environments that spiders inhabit have further shaped courtship content and form. While our understanding of spider neurobiology remains in its infancy, recent studies are highlighting the unique and considerable capacities of spiders to process and respond to complex sexual signals. As a result, the dangerous mating systems of spiders are providing important insights into how ecology shapes the evolution of communication systems, with future work offering the potential to link this complex communication with its neural processes.},

A new method of counting cells has made it easy to obtain direct estimates of the numbers of neurons that compose different brain structures. Crossing these numbers with the first large-scale quantitative studies of cognitive capabilities across species suggests that absolute numbers of neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex, or in the bird pallium, are good correlates of cognitive diversity: the more the neurons, regardless of brain or body size, the better a species performs at a same task.},

Now, for the first time, the adaptation of modern neurophysiological methods to the study of the central nervous system of the octopus allows this avenue of research. The emerging results suggest that a convergent evolutionary process has led to the selection of vertebrate-like neural organization and activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity. As octopuses and vertebrates are very remote phylogenetically, this convergence suggests the importance of the shared properties for the mediation of learning and memory.},

Crows habitually used mostly A. moluccana leaf-stems to extract larvae from holes and manufacture was also common when birds removed leaves from leaf-stems before using tools. The techniques of adult crows varied but were more proficient than those of a juvenile crow that frequented the site. Tool-use to extract Cerambycidae from dead wood was probably an important part of the foraging behaviour of the crows year-round.

They are known to target certain tree species that produce twigs of the right natural shape for easy conversion into tools. All previously identified species supplying tool materials have been native or endemic to New Caledonia. Here I report that crows living in disturbed habitats also use the barbed twigs of an introduced climbing plant, Lantana camara, as tools. Over an 8‐year period I collected 12 L. camara tools used by NC crows at three locations: Bourail and Sarraméa, on mainland Grande Terre, and on the island of Maré. I found these tools left in natural probe sites (Bourail and Sarraméa) or at artificial feeding sites (Maré), but I do not know if the crows targeted L. camara or simply used the closest suitable material. Nevertheless, the use of L. camara indicates that the behaviour of certain free‐living NC crows is sufficiently flexible to enable them to evaluate and use exotic plants for tool material.},

We observed (1) a bias for making tools on left edges consistent with that previously found at the site, (2) faithful manufacture of a stepped design with high overall congruence in the shapes of tools, (3) the use of convergent rips to first form the tapered end working away from the trunk then the wide end working towards the trunk, (4) appropriate functional use of stepped tools by use of the leaf-edge barbs to hook food from holes, and (5) consistent holding of tools on the left side of its head when using them.

In this paper, a strictly energetic perspective is applied to identify general mammalian correlates of brain size evolution. In both marsupials and placentals, the duration or intensity of maternal investment is a key correlate of relative brain size, but here I show that allomaternal energy subsidies may also play a role. In marsupials, an energetic constraint on brain size in adults is only revealed if we consider both metabolic and reproductive rates simultaneously, because a strong trade-off between encephalization and offspring production masks the positive correlation between basal metabolic rate and brain size in a bivariate comparison. In conclusion, starting from an energetic perspective is warranted to elucidate relations between ecology, social systems, life history, and brain size in all mammals.},

	abstract = {To explain variation in relative brain size among homoiothermic vertebrates, we propose the Expensive Brain hypothesis as a unifying explanatory framework. It claims that the costs of a relatively large brain must be met by any combination of increased total energy turnover or reduced energy allocation to another expensive function such as digestion, locomotion, or production (growth and reproduction). Focusing on the energetic costs of brain enlargement, a comparative analysis of the largest mammalian sample assembled to date shows that an increase in brain size leads to larger neonates among all mammals and a longer period of immaturity among monotokous precocial species, but not among the polytokous altricial ones, who instead reduce their litter size. Relatively large brained mammals, altricial and precocial, also show reduced annual fertility rates as compared to their smaller brained relatives, but allomaternal energy inputs allow some cooperatively breeding altricial carnivores to produce even more offspring in a shorter time despite having a relatively large brain. Thus, the Expensive Brain framework explains why brain size is linked to life history pace in some, but not all mammalian lineages. This framework encompasses other hypotheses of energetic constraints on brain size variation and is also compatible with the Brain Malnutrition Risk hypothesis, but the absence of a mammal-wide correlation between brain size and immature period argues against the Needing-to-Learn explanation for slower development among large brained mammals.},

In combination with body mass data from wild individuals, strong correlations between endocranial volume and body mass within taxonomic groups were found. Errors attributable to different techniques for measuring cranial capacity were negligible and unbiased. The overall slopes for regressions of log ECV on log body mass in primates are 0.773 for least-squares regression and 0.793 for reduced major axis regression. The least-squares slope is reduced to 0.565 when independent contrasts are substituted for species means (branch lengths from molecular studies). A common slope of 0.646 is obtained with logged species means when grade shifts between major groups are taken into account using ANCOVA. In addition to providing a comprehensive and reliable database for comparative analyses of primate brain size, we show that the scaling relationship between brain mass and ECV does not differ significantly from isometry in primates. We also demonstrate that ECV does not differ substantially between captive and wild samples of the same species. ECV may be a more reliable indicator of brain size than brain mass, because considerably larger samples can be collected to better represent the full range of intraspecific variation. We also provide support for the maternal energy hypothesis by showing that basal metabolic rate (BMR) and gestation period are both positively correlated with brain size in primates, after controlling for the influence of body mass and potential effects of phylogenetic relatedness.},

Both conventional and phylogenetically based comparative statistics were used in conjunction with three alternative phylogenetic trees of the species examined. The comparisons between brood parasitism and relative brain size yielded mixed results, depending upon both the statistical method and the phylogeny employed. Although this could indicate that the evolution of interspecific brood parasitism is not related to relative brain size, the limitations of the comparative method in conjunction with the mixed results make it impossible to determine this with any certainty. The fact that different phylogenetic relationships yielded different results highlights the importance of phylogenetic relationships in assessing brain-behavior relationships. The continued use of phylogenetically based comparative methods should therefore be done cautiously, particularly with respect to interpretation of the results as the outcome may be as dependent upon the phylogeny as it is on the data itself.},

The caprimulgiforms we examined included nightjars (Caprimulgidae), owlet-nightjars (Aegothelidae), potoos (Nyctibiidae), frogmouths (Podargidae) and the Oilbird (Steatornithidae). The owlet-nightjars and frogmouths shared almost identical relative brain, telencephalic and Wulst volumes as well as overall brain morphology and Wulst morphology with owls. Specifically, the owls, frogmouths and owlet-nightjars possess relatively large brains and telencephalic and Wulst volumes, had a characteristic brain shape and displayed prominent laminae in the Wulst. In contrast, potoos and nightjars both had relatively small brains and telencephala, and Wulst volumes that are typical for similarly sized birds from other orders. The Oilbird had a large brain, telencephalon and Wulst, although these measures were not quite as large as those of the owls. This gradation of owl-like versus nightjar-like brains within caprimulgiforms has significant implications for understanding the evolution of stereopsis and the Wulst both within the order and birds in general.},

Relative brain size was compared between volant and flightless species using both conventional statistics and modern comparative methods within nine taxonomic groups. No significant difference was found between flightless and volant species in six of these groups, regardless of whether body mass or tibiotarsal measurements were used as estimates of body size. Species with relatively smaller brains compared with their volant relatives were the great auk Pinguinus impennis, the kakapo Strigops habroptilus and some species of penguin. Thus, we found no evidence of a general correlation between the evolution of secondary flightlessness and the evolution of relatively small brains in birds.

Arthropods have brains much smaller and simpler than those of birds and mammals. This raises questions concerning limitations on how intricate the decision-making processes might be in arthropods. At Los Baños in the Philippines, Scytodes pallidus is a spitting spider that specialises in preying on jumping spiders, and Portia labiata is a jumping spider that preys on S. pallidus. Scytodid spit comes from the mouth, and egg-carrying females are less dangerous than eggless scytodids because the female uses her chelicerae to hold her eggs. Held eggs block her mouth, and she has to release them before she can spit. The Los Baños P. labiata sometimes adjusts its tactics depending on whether the scytodid encountered is carrying eggs or not. When pursuing eggless scytodids, the Los Baños P. labiata usually takes detour routes that enable it to close in from behind (away from the scytodid's line of fire). However, when pursuing egg-carrying scytodids, the Los Baños P. labiata sometimes takes faster direct routes to reach these safer prey. The Los Baños P. labiata apparently makes risk-related adjustments specific to whether scytodids are carrying eggs, but P. labiata from Sagada in the Philippines (allopatric to Scytodes) fails to make comparable risk-related adjustments.},

	abstract = {String pulling is one of the most widely used paradigms in comparative psychology. First documented 2 millennia ago, it has been a well-established scientific paradigm for a century. More than 160 bird and mammal species have been tested in over 200 studies with countless methodological variations. The paradigm can be used to address a wide variety of issues on animal cognition; for example, what animals understand about contact and connection as well as whether they rely on perceptual feedback, grasp the functionality of strings, generalize across conditions, apply their knowledge flexibly, and possess insight. Mammals are typically tested on a horizontal configuration, birds on a vertical one, making the studies difficult to compare; in particular, pulling a string vertically requires better coordination and attention. A species’ performance on the paradigm is often influenced by its ecology, especially concerning whether limbs are used for foraging. Many other factors can be of importance and should be considered. The string-pulling paradigm is easy to administer, vary, and apply to investigate a wide array of cognitive abilities. Although it can be and has been used to compare species, divergent methods and unclear reporting have limited its comparative utility. With increasing research standards, the paradigm is expected to become an even more fundamental tool in comparative psychology.},

However, the conclusions reached by such work have a key limitation: the cognitive tests themselves. If factors other than cognition can systematically affect the performance of a subset of animals on these tests, we risk drawing the wrong conclusions about how intelligence evolves. Here, we examined whether this is the case for the A-not-B task, recently used by MacLean and co-workers to study self-control among 36 different species. Non-primates performed poorly on this task; possibly because they have difficulty tracking the movements of a human demonstrator, and not because they lack self-control. To test this, we assessed the performance of New Caledonian crows on the A-not-B task before and after two types of training. New Caledonian crows trained to track rewards moved by a human demonstrator were more likely to pass the A-not-B test than birds trained on an unrelated choice task involving inhibitory control. Our findings demonstrate that overlooked task demands can affect performance on a cognitive task, and so bring into question MacLean's conclusion that absolute brain size best predicts self-control.},

To date, the performance of corvids suggests that they can recognize the functional properties of a variety of objects including size, weight and solidity, and they seem to be more capable of learning from causal information than arbitrary information. However, 2 alternative explanations for their performance have yet to be ruled out. The perceptual-motor feedback hypothesis suggests that subjects may attend solely to the movement of the reward, repeating actions which bring the reward closer, while the object-bias hypothesis suggests that subjects could pass certain tasks by preferring to handle objects that resemble natural stones. Here we review our current understanding of performance on the Aesop's Fable tasks, and suggest that studies controlling for feedback and object preferences will help us determine exactly what animals understand about the cause and effect of water displacement.},

We found that crows preferentially dropped stones into a water-filled tube instead of a sand-filled tube; they dropped sinking objects rather than floating objects; solid objects rather than hollow objects, and they dropped objects into a tube with a high water level rather than a low one. However, they failed two more challenging tasks which required them to attend to the width of the tube, and to counter-intuitive causal cues in a U-shaped apparatus. Our results indicate that New Caledonian crows possess a sophisticated, but incomplete, understanding of the causal properties of displacement, rivalling that of 5–7 year old children.},

Birds and mammals, on the other hand, may be considered to be "higher" vertebrates with respect to brain evolution. The size of their brains relative to body size increased in successive geological eras, presumably in response to selection pressures on higher vertebrates for increased neural control and information processing. Within the several vertebrate classes there are, of course, neural specializations reflected in enlargement of different brain structures in different species. These are adaptations to niches which require different kinds of information processing and neural control. Changes in total brain size, however, are associated with gross increments in total information processing capacity, and major changes have apparently not occurred in the evolution of the lower vertebrates.},

The most precise quantitative analyses have been of relative brain size, or structural encephalization, undertaken to find biological correlates of mind in animals. Encephalization and its evolution are remarkably orderly, and if the idea of intelligence were unknown it would have to be invented to explain encephalization. The scientific question is: what behaviour or dimensions of behaviour evolved when encephalization evolved? The answer: the relatively unusual behaviours that require increased neural information processing capacity, beyond that attributable to differences among species in body size. In this perspective, the different behaviours that depend on augmented processing capacity in different species are evidence of different intelligences (in the plural) that have evolved.},

Such motor self-regulation facilitates more rational behaviour, as it brings economy into the bodily interaction with the physical and social world. It also underlies certain complex cognitive processes including decision making. Recently, MacLean et al. (MacLean et al. 2014 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 111, 2140–2148. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1323533111)) conducted a large-scale study involving 36 species, comparing motor self-regulation across taxa. They concluded that absolute brain size predicts level of performance. The great apes were most successful. Only a few of the species tested were birds. Given birds' small brain size—in absolute terms—yet flexible behaviour, their motor self-regulation calls for closer study. Corvids exhibit some of the largest relative avian brain sizes—although small in absolute measure—as well as the most flexible cognition in the animal kingdom. We therefore tested ravens, New Caledonian crows and jackdaws in the so-called cylinder task. We found performance indistinguishable from that of great apes despite the much smaller brains. We found both absolute and relative brain volume to be a reliable predictor of performance within Aves. The complex cognition of corvids is often likened to that of great apes; our results show further that they share similar fundamental cognitive mechanisms.},

Such regions have been previously implicated in social perception and associative memory, respectively. We further show that variability in the size of such online friendship networks was significantly correlated with the size of more intimate real-world social groups. However, the brain regions we identified were specifically associated with online social network size, whereas the grey matter density of the amygdala was correlated both with online and real-world social network sizes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the size of an individual's online social network is closely linked to focal brain structure implicated in social cognition.},

We suggest that large-brained females have a cognitive advantage that allows them to better evade predation, whereas large-brained males are more colourful, which may counteract any potential benefits of brain size.

Although the hypothesis is supported by both comparative and experimental evidence, little is known about the potential changes in energetic requirements or digestive traits following such evolutionary shifts in brain and gut size. Organisms may meet the greater metabolic requirements of larger brains despite smaller guts via increased food intake or better digestion. But increased investment in the brain may also hamper somatic growth. To test these hypotheses we here used guppy (Poecilia reticulata) brain size selection lines with a pronounced negative association between brain and gut size and investigated feeding propensity, digestive efficiency (DE), and juvenile growth rate. We did not find any difference in feeding propensity or DE between large- and small-brained individuals. Instead, we found that large-brained females had slower growth during the first 10 weeks after birth. Our study provides experimental support that investment into larger brains at the expense of gut tissue carries costs that are not necessarily compensated by a more efficient digestive system.},

Individual scales were transplanted between pairs of fish, creating reciprocal allografts, and the rejection reaction was scored over 8 days (before acquired immunity develops). Acquired immune responses were tested two weeks later, when the same pairs of fish received a second set of allografts and were scored again. Compared with large-brained animals, small-brained animals of both sexes mounted a significantly stronger rejection response to the first allograft. The rejection response to the second set of allografts did not differ between large- and small-brained fish.

	abstract = {Animal personalities range from individuals that are shy, cautious, and easily stressed (a “reactive” personality type) to individuals that are bold, innovative, and quick to learn novel tasks, but also prone to routine formation (a “proactive” personality type). Although personality differences should have important consequences for fitness, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated how genetic variation in brain size affects personality. We put selection lines of large- and small-brained guppies (Poecilia reticulata), with known differences in cognitive ability, through three standard personality assays. First, we found that large-brained animals were faster to habituate to, and more exploratory in, open field tests. Large-brained females were also bolder. Second, large-brained animals excreted less cortisol in a stressful situation (confinement). Third, large-brained animals were slower to feed from a novel food source, which we interpret as being caused by reduced behavioral flexibility rather than lack of innovation in the large-brained lines. Overall, the results point toward a more proactive personality type in large-brained animals. Thus, this study provides the first experimental evidence linking brain size and personality, an interaction that may affect important fitness-related aspects of ecology such as dispersal and niche exploration.},

	abstract = {Summary
The large variation in brain size that exists in the animal kingdom has been suggested to have evolved through the balance between selective advantages of greater cognitive ability and the prohibitively high energy demands of a larger brain (the “expensive-tissue hypothesis” [1]). Despite over a century of research on the evolution of brain size, empirical support for the trade-off between cognitive ability and energetic costs is based exclusively on correlative evidence [2], and the theory remains controversial [3, 4]. Here we provide experimental evidence for costs and benefits of increased brain size. We used artificial selection for large and small brain size relative to body size in a live-bearing fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and found that relative brain size evolved rapidly in response to divergent selection in both sexes. Large-brained females outperformed small-brained females in a numerical learning assay designed to test cognitive ability. Moreover, large-brained lines, especially males, developed smaller guts, as predicted by the expensive-tissue hypothesis [1], and produced fewer offspring. We propose that the evolution of brain size is mediated by a functional trade-off between increased cognitive ability and reproductive performance and discuss the implications of these findings for vertebrate brain evolution.},

Field and laboratory studies have demonstrated that food-storing species have an impressive memory and an enlarged region of the brain, the hippocampal region. Lesion experiments have shown that the hippocampus is important in accurate retrieval of stored food. Taken together, these results have led to the hypothesis that the enlarged hippocampus is associated with the memory requirements of retrieving stored food. In this review, we discuss four areas of study: comparative studies of the brain, comparative studies of behaviour, developmental plasticity and seasonal changes in food storing and the hippocampus.},

Although studies of twins consistently indicate that a significant genetic component is involved, most families segregating speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance, and a gene that predisposes individuals to such disorders has not been identified. We have studied a unique three-generation pedigree, KE, in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. Our previous work mapped the locus responsible, SPCH1, to a 5.6-cM interval of region 7q31 on chromosome 7 (ref. 5). We also identified an unrelated individual, CS, in whom speech and language impairment is associated with a chromosomal translocation involving the SPCH1 interval. Here we show that the gene FOXP2, which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain, is directly disrupted by the translocation breakpoint in CS. In addition, we identify a point mutation in affected members of the KE family that alters an invariant amino-acid residue in the forkhead domain. Our findings suggest that FOXP2 is involved in the developmental process that culminates in speech and language.},

Mayr argued that proximate causes (e.g. physiological factors) and ultimate causes (e.g. natural selection) addressed distinct ‘how’ and ‘why’ questions and were not competing alternatives. That distinction retains explanatory value today. However, the adoption of Mayr’s heuristic led to the widespread belief that ontogenetic processes are irrelevant to evolutionary questions, a belief that has (1) hindered progress within evolutionary biology, (2) forged divisions between evolutionary biology and adjacent disciplines and (3) obstructed several contemporary debates in biology. Here we expand on our earlier (Laland et al. in Science 334:1512–1516, 2011) argument that Mayr’s dichotomous formulation has now run its useful course, and that evolutionary biology would be better served by a concept of reciprocal causation, in which causation is perceived to cycle through biological systems recursively.

Both the absolute and relative frequencies (corrected for species number per order) of innovations differ between bird orders in a similar fashion in the two geographical zones. Absolute and relative frequency of innovations per order are also related to two measures of relative forebrain size in the two zones. The study confirms predicted trends linking opportunism, brain size and rate of structural evolution.

Grackles demonstrated behavioral flexibility in two contexts, the Aesop’s Fable paradigm and a color association test. Contrary to predictions, behavioral flexibility did not correlate across contexts. Four out of 6 grackles exhibited efficient problem solving abilities, but problem solving efficiency did not appear to be directly linked with behavioral flexibility. Problem solving speed also did not significantly correlate with reversal learning scores, indicating that faster learners were not the most flexible.

Great-tailed grackles are behaviourally flexible in that they can change their preferences when a task changes using existing behaviours; however, it is unknown how far they will go to invent solutions to novel problems. To begin to answer this question, I gave grackles two novel tests that a variety of other species can perform: stick tool use and string pulling. No grackle used a stick to access out-of-reach food, even after seeing a human demonstrate the solution. No grackle spontaneously pulled a vertically oriented string, but one did pull a horizontally oriented string twice. Additionally, a third novel test was previously conducted on these individuals and it was found that no grackle spontaneously dropped stones down a platform apparatus to release food, but six out of eight did become proficient after training. These results support the idea that behavioural flexibility is a multi-faceted trait because grackles are flexible, but not particularly innovative. This contradicts the idea that behavioural flexibility and innovativeness are interchangeable terms.},

	abstract = {A fossilized skeleton discovered in 1856 presented naturalists with a unique challenge. The strange, human-looking bones of the first recognized Neanderthal confronted naturalists with a new type of object for which they had no readily available interpretive framework. This paper explores the techniques and approaches used to understand these bones in the years immediately following the discovery, in particular 1856-1864. Historians have previously suggested that interpretations and debates about Neanderthals hinged primarily on social, political and cultural ideologies. In this paper, I will argue that much of the scientific controversy surrounding the first recognized Neanderthal centred on questions of methodology and practice, and will demonstrate this through an exploration of the tools and approaches naturalists utilized in their examinations of the fossils. This will contribute to a growing historical recognition of the complex exchange between disciplines including geology, archaeology and comparative anatomy in the early study of fossil hominins, and provide a future framework for histories of Neanderthal debates in the twentieth century.},

The second part of this definition requires the inhibition of previously learnt solution strategies before a novel solution can be found. Therefore, inventing novel solutions for an old problem is considered to be particularly difficult. We investigated the ability of great apes to produce multiple new solutions to a task after each of those solutions became obsolete. We presented all four nonhuman great ape species with a task consisting of extracting a food reward from a puzzle box. Initially, the task could be solved in three different ways that varied in difficulty. After subjects discovered the first solution, we allowed them to use it for some trials and then it became obsolete. If the apes could overcome their initial response and find the next solution, we again allowed them to use it for some time and once again it became obsolete. The final step consisted of finding the third solution to secure the food reward. We found that all species except orang-utans, Pongo abelii, were able to solve all versions of the problem. Furthermore, they overcame the obsolete techniques quickly and efficiently, indicating high degrees of behavioural flexibility and inhibitory control. In contrast to previous research on social learning, our results suggest that great apes are not conservative and adjust their behaviour flexibly when the physical constraints of a task change.},

Recently, philosophers have developed Levins’ claims, arguing that trade-offs between these desiderata are generated by practical limitations on scientists, or due to formal aspects of models and how they represent the world. However this project is not complete. The trade-offs discussed by Levins had a noticeable effect on modelling in population biology, but not on other sciences.

	abstract = {Summary
Jumping spiders (Salticidae) are renowned for a behavioral repertoire that can seem more vertebrate, or even mammalian, than spider-like in character [1–3]. This is made possible by a unique visual system that supports their stalking hunting style and elaborate mating rituals in which the bizarrely marked and colored appendages of males highlight their song-and-dance displays [2, 4, 5]. Salticids perform these tasks with information from four pairs of functionally specialized eyes, providing a near 360° field of view and forward-looking spatial resolution surpassing that of all insects and even some mammals [1], processed by a brain roughly the size of a poppy seed. Salticid behavior, evolution, and ecology are well documented [6–8], but attempts to study the neurophysiological basis of their behavior had been thwarted by the pressurized nature of their internal body fluids, making typical physiological techniques infeasible and restricting all previous neural work in salticids to a few recordings from the eyes [9, 10]. We report the first survey of neurophysiological recordings from the brain of a jumping spider, Phidippus audax (Salticidae). The data include single-unit recordings in response to artificial and naturalistic visual stimuli. The salticid visual system is unique in that high-acuity and motion vision are processed by different pairs of eyes [1]. We found nonlinear interactions between the principal and secondary eyes, which can be inferred from the emergence of spatiotemporal receptive fields. Ecologically relevant images, including prey-like objects such as flies, elicited bursts of excitation from single units.},

We show that behavioural complexity in the honeybee cannot be explained by independent functions of vertically arranged, domain-specific processing modules, but requires horizontal integration in a central state, and we identify neural mechanisms that may underlie domain-specific processing and central integration. The honeybee may serve as a useful model for the study of intermediate levels of complexity in cognitive functions and the search for their neural substrates.},

	abstract = {Cognition is an integrating process that utilizes phylogenetic and individual memory, creates an internal representation of the world and a basis for expecting the future of the animal’s own actions within the experienced environment. It thus allows the animal to decide between different options in reference to the expected outcome of its potential actions. All these processes occur as intrinsic properties of the nervous system and provide an implicit form of knowledge for controlling behavior. This article shows that such processes must be assumed to also exist in invertebrates with proper nervous systems (albeit over a large range of levels of complexity) to account for their behavior. We first consider forms of behavior that are dominated by innate components, and raise the questions of how innate and learned behavior are related and whether innate behavior involves cognitive components. Then we focus on experience-dependent forms of behavior and follow in the order of ascending complexity: from elemental forms of associative learning to rule learning and observatory learning in navigation and communication. We discuss both aspects of memory, as a storing device and in the form of working memory, the implicit form of representation which may provide the substrate for neural operations underlying decision making in relation to the expected outcome of the animal’s actions.},

Here we survey new findings indicating that the memory used by bees to navigate within the range of their orientation flights is much more complex than hitherto thought. It appears to allow them to decide between at least two goals in the field, and to steer towards them over considerable distances. Two models concerning the structure of bees’ spatial memory are developed from new empirical evidence. The first one relies on the integration of at least two flight vectors, while the second assumes the existence of a ‘functional’ map based on the information available on-site. These findings also raise questions about the process of encoding and decoding information in the context of the waggle dance. We review published data and recent evidence indicating that memories of topographical features might also be involved in dance communication, and point out what needs to be addressed to elucidate the corresponding memory demands. The flight paths of recruited bees can now be traced by means of radar techniques, and thus tools are available to tackle these questions.},

	abstract = {Behavioural flexibility is often treated as the gold standard of evidence for more sophisticated or complex forms of animal cognition, such as planning, metacognition and mindreading. However, the evidential link between behavioural flexibility and complex cognition has not been explicitly or systematically defended. Such a defence is particularly pressing because observed flexible behaviours can frequently be explained by putatively simpler cognitive mechanisms. This leaves complex cognition hypotheses open to ‘deflationary’ challenges that are accorded greater evidential weight precisely because they offer putatively simpler explanations of equal explanatory power. This paper challenges the blanket preference for simpler explanations, and shows that once this preference is dispensed with, and the full spectrum of evidence—including evolutionary, ecological and phylogenetic data—is accorded its proper weight, an argument in support of the prevailing assumption that behavioural flexibility can serve as evidence for complex cognitive mechanisms may begin to take shape. An adaptive model of cognitive-behavioural evolution is proposed, according to which the existence of convergent trait–environment clusters in phylogenetically disparate lineages may serve as evidence for the same trait–environment clusters in other lineages. This, in turn, could permit inferences of cognitive complexity in cases of experimental underdetermination, thereby placing the common view that behavioural flexibility can serve as evidence for complex cognition on firmer grounds.},

While there is a relatively mature literature on post mortem diffusion imaging of animals, human brains have proven more challenging due to their incompatibility with high-performance scanners. This study presents a method for post mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains using a clinical 3-Tesla scanner with a 3D segmented EPI spin-echo sequence. Results in eleven brains at 0.94 × 0.94 × 0.94 mm resolution are presented, and in a single brain at 0.73 × 0.73 × 0.73 mm resolution. Region-of-interest analysis of diffusion tensor parameters indicate that these properties are altered compared to in vivo (reduced diffusivity and anisotropy), with significant dependence on post mortem interval (time from death to fixation). Despite these alterations, diffusion tractography of several major tracts is successfully demonstrated at both resolutions. We also report novel findings of cortical anisotropy and partial volume effects.},

	abstract = {The ability to reason about causality underlies key aspects of human cognition, but the extent to which non-humans understand causality is still largely unknown. The Aesop’s Fable paradigm, where objects are inserted into water-filled tubes to obtain out-of-reach rewards, has been used to test casual reasoning in birds and children. However, success on these tasks may be influenced by other factors, specifically, object preferences present prior to testing or arising during pre-test stone-dropping training. Here, we assessed this ‘object-bias’ hypothesis by giving New Caledonian crows and 5–10 year old children two object-choice Aesop’s Fable experiments: sinking vs. floating objects, and solid vs. hollow objects. Before each test, we assessed subjects’ object preferences and/or trained them to prefer the alternative object. Both crows and children showed pre-test object preferences, suggesting that birds in previous Aesop’s Fable studies may also have had initial preferences for objects that proved to be functional on test. After training to prefer the non-functional object, crows, but not children, performed more poorly on these two object-choice Aesop’s Fable tasks than subjects in previous studies. Crows dropped the non-functional objects into the tube on their first trials, indicating that, unlike many children, they do not appear to have an a priori understanding of water displacement. Alternatively, issues with inhibition could explain their performance. The crows did, however, learn to solve the tasks over time. We tested crows further to determine whether their eventual success was based on learning about the functional properties of the objects, or associating dropping the functional object with reward. Crows inserted significantly more rewarded, non-functional objects than non-rewarded, functional objects. These findings suggest that the ability of New Caledonian crows to produce performances rivaling those of young children on object-choice Aesop’s Fable tasks is partly due to pre-existing object preferences.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

	abstract = {Parasitism can negatively affect learning and cognition, setting the scene for coevolution between brain and immunity. Greater susceptibility to parasitism by males may impair their cognitive ability, and relatively greater male investment in immunity could compensate for greater susceptibility to parasites, in particular when males have a relatively large brain. We analysed covariation between relative size of immune defence organs and brain in juvenile and adult birds. The relative size of the bursa of Fabricius and the spleen in adults covaried positively with relative brain size across bird species. The relative size of these two immune defence organs covaried with sex differences in relative size of the brain, indicating that the relationship between immune defence and brain size was stronger for males. In contrast, liver and heart size or sexual size dimorphism in size did not covary with immune defence. Thus, species in which males have relatively large brains also have relatively large immune defence organs.},

	abstract = {During speciation across ecological gradients, diverging populations are exposed to contrasting sensory and spatial information that present new behavioural and perceptive challenges. These challenges may be met by heritable or environmentally induced changes in brain function which mediate behaviour. However, few studies have investigated patterns of neural divergence at the early stages of speciation, inhibiting our understanding of the relative importance of these processes. Here, we provide a novel case study. The incipient species pair, Heliconius erato and H. himera, are parapatric across an environmental and altitudinal gradient. Despite ongoing gene flow, these species have divergent ecological, behavioural and physiological traits. We demonstrate that these taxa also differ significantly in brain composition, in particular in the relative levels of investment in structures that process sensory information. These differences are not explained solely by environmentally-induced plasticity, but include heritable, nonallometric shifts in brain structure. We suggest these differences reflect divergence to meet the demands of contrasting sensory ecologies. This conclusion would support the hypothesis that the evolution of brain structure and function play an important role in facilitating the emergence of ecologically distinct species.},

Cetaceans are remarkably diverse, varying in both phenotypes by several orders of magnitude, with notable differences between the two extant suborders, Mysticeti and Odontoceti. We analyzed the evolutionary history of brain and body mass, and relative brain size measured by the encephalization quotient (EQ), using a data set of extinct and extant taxa to capture temporal variation in the mode and direction of evolution. Our results suggest that cetacean brain and body mass evolved under strong directional trends to increase through time, but decreases in EQ were widespread. Mysticetes have significantly lower EQs than odontocetes due to a shift in brain:body allometry following the divergence of the suborders, caused by rapid increases in body mass in Mysticeti and a period of body mass reduction in Odontoceti. The pattern in Cetacea contrasts with that in primates, which experienced strong trends to increase brain mass and relative brain size, but not body mass. We discuss what these analyses reveal about the convergent evolution of large brains, and highlight that until recently the most encephalized mammals were odontocetes, not primates.},

These volumetric differences represent changes in cell number, size, and/or connectivity, which may denote changes in the functional and evolutionary relationships between different brain regions, and between brain composition and behavioral ecology. Here we describe the brain composition of two species of Heliconius butterflies, a long-standing study system for investigating ecological adaptation and speciation. We confirm a previous report of a striking volumetric expansion of the mushroom body, and explore patterns of differential posteclosion and experience-dependent plasticity between different brain regions. This analysis uncovers age- and experience-dependent posteclosion mushroom body growth comparable to that in foraging Hymenoptera, but also identifies plasticity in several other neuropils. An interspecific analysis indicates that Heliconius display a remarkably large investment in mushroom bodies for a lepidopteran, and indeed rank highly compared to other insects. Our analyses lay the foundation for future comparative and experimental analyses that will establish Heliconius as a valuable case study in evolutionary neurobiology. J. Comp.

One factor that may have contributed to mask the knowledge that subjects may have about the task is that subjects were only allowed to push the reward away from them, which is a particularly difficult action for primates in certain problem solving situations. We presented five orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), two chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), two bonobos (Pan paniscus), and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a modified trap tube that allowed subjects to push or rake the reward with the tool. In two additional follow-up tests, we inverted the tube 180° rendering the trap nonfunctional and also presented subjects with the original task in which they were required to push the reward out of the tube. Results showed that all but one of the subjects preferred to rake the reward. Two orangutans and one chimpanzee (all of whom preferred to rake the reward), consistently avoided the trap only when it was functional but failed the original task. These findings suggest that some great apes may have some causal knowledge about the trap-tube task. Their success, however, depended on whether they were allowed to choose certain tool-using actions.},

Meta-analysis in biological sciences, especially in ecology and evolution (which we refer to as ‘biological’ meta-analysis) faces somewhat different methodological problems from its counterparts in medical and social sciences, where meta-analytic techniques were originally developed. The main reason for such differences is that biological meta-analysis often integrates complex data composed of multiple strata with, for example, different measurements and a variety of species. Here, we review methodological issues and advancements in biological meta-analysis, focusing on three topics: (1) non-independence arising from multiple effect sizes obtained in single studies and from phylogenetic relatedness, (2) detecting and accounting for heterogeneity, and (3) identifying publication bias and measuring its impact. We show how the marriage between mixed-effects (hierarchical/multilevel) models and phylogenetic comparative methods has resolved most of the issues under discussion. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of across-study and within-study meta-analysis, and propose how the use of within-study meta-analysis can improve many empirical studies typical of ecology and evolution.},

Such independent evolution is possible only if genetic correlations among the different brain regions are less than unity. We estimated heritabilities, evolvabilities and genetic correlations of relative size of the brain, and its different regions in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We found that heritabilities were low (average h2 = 0.24), suggesting a large plastic component to brain architecture. However, evolvabilities of different brain parts were moderate, suggesting the presence of additive genetic variance to sustain a response to selection in the long term. Genetic correlations among different brain regions were low (average rG = 0.40) and significantly less than unity. These results, along with those from analyses of phenotypic and genetic integration, indicate a high degree of independence between different brain regions, suggesting that responses to selection are unlikely to be severely constrained by genetic and phenotypic correlations. Hence, the results give strong support for the mosaic model of brain evolution. However, the genetic correlation between brain and body size was high (rG = 0.89), suggesting a constraint for independent evolution of brain and body size in sticklebacks.},

	abstract = {Studies investigating the same paradigm but employing different methods are often directly compared in the literature. One such paradigm used to assess behavioural flexibility in animals is reversal learning. Commonly, these studies require individuals to learn the reward contingency of either solid objects presented on the ground or images presented on a touchscreen. Once learned, these contingencies are swapped. Researchers often refer to trials required to reach learning criteria from different studies, to compare the flexibility of different species, but rarely take methodological differences into account. A direct evaluation of the validity of such comparisons is lacking. To address this latent question, we confronted kea, an alpine parrot species of New Zealand and known for its behavioural flexibility, with a standard reversal learning paradigm on the touchscreen and a standard reversal learning paradigm with solid objects. The kea required significantly more trials to reach criterion in the acquisition and the reversal on the touchscreen. Also, the absolute increase in the number of trials required for the reversal was significantly greater on the touchscreen. This indicates that it is not valid to compare learning speed across studies that do not correspond in the addressed methodology. Taking into account the kea's ecology and explorative nature we discuss stimulus abstraction (limited depth cues and tactile stimulus feedback) and the spatial relation between reward and stimulus on the touchscreen as possible causes for decreased inhibition in this condition. Contrary to the absolute increase in number of trials required for the reversal, the increase in relation to the acquisition was greater with solid objects. This highlights the need for further research on the mechanisms involved causing methodology-dependent differences, some of which we discuss, in order to increase the validity of interpretations across studies and in respect to the subject's ecology.},

In birds, foraging innovations have been observed in over 800 species, and include behaviours that range from eating a novel food to using tools. Previous comparative studies have quantified innovativeness by summing all reports of innovative behaviour, regardless of the nature of the innovation. Here, we use the variety of foraging innovations recorded for birds to see which of two classic hypotheses best accounts for the relationship between innovativeness and brain size: the technical intelligence hypothesis or the opportunistic-generalism intelligence hypothesis. We classified 2182 innovation cases into 12 categories to quantify the diversity of innovations performed by each of 76 avian families. We found that families with larger brains had a greater repertoire of innovations, and that innovation diversity was a stronger predictor of residual brain size than was total number of innovations. Furthermore, the diversity of technical innovations displayed by bird families was a much better predictor of residual brain size than was the number of food type innovations, providing support for the technical intelligence hypothesis. Our results suggest that the cognitive capacity required to perform a wide variety of novel foraging techniques underpins the positive relationship between innovativeness and brain size in birds. We include a summary of innovation data for 803 species as Supplementary Material.},

	abstract = {Resemblances between cephalopods and fish 1. Modern cephalopods (coleoids {\textless} 1000 species) resemble modern fish (30,000 species) more closely than any of their ancestors did. They have not been replaced by the more diversified group in geological time. 2. The main body of the article (pp. 245–283) reviews these resemblances. They are to be found at all levels of analysis. 3. Basic physiological mechanisms of molluscs (pp. 262–5) have been incorporated into systems with performances comparable to those of vertebrate systems. For instance the cephalopod locomotory system (pp. 249–56) and hydrostatic control system (pp. 256–60), structurally very different from their fish counterparts, have similar adaptive radiation. 4. Behaviour (p. 278) and growth of the brain (p. 265) are characteristically vertebrate-like. 5. Cephalopods and fish are considered as occupying the same broad adaptive zone though modal differences (pp. 283–5)-in reproductive habits, growth rate and light-dependent behaviour where extraocular photoreceptors appear to be important - mean that they occupy different areas within that zone. (ii) Evolution of convergence 6. Evidence is presented (pp. 287–293) for considering the convergence as due not merely to similar physical demands of the marine environment, but to dynamic interactions between cephalopods and vertebrates from the late Palaeozoic onwards. 7. The convergence was set on its way when the two groups, independently of each other, acquired locomotory methods that allowed them to increase in size. 8. It is argued that reduction and eventually complete loss of the chambered shell (in all but sepiids) was an evolutionary response to the needs of increased mobility and to the need to go deeper as vertebrate predators pushed out into oceanic waters. 9. The ammonites (pp. 291–2) present a partial model of the course that coleoid ancestors may have taken. 10. Coleoids subsequently reinvaded surface and coastal waters, competing successfully in a teleost habitat. Their most striking adaptations are ones that they share with teleosts. 11. Behavioural interactions in a vertebrate-dominated environment have probably been responsible for the vertebrate-type eye of cephalopods (p. 293). 12. The conclusion that the common adaptive zone shared by cephalopods and fish has been achieved by mutual interactions between the two groups evokes no special evolutionary principles. It assumes that all cephalopod species have (at some period of their evolutionary history) been in competition for food with some vertebrate species and that vertebrates are a source of selection pressures - largely operating through visual behaviour - that maintain and promote convergence upon the ‘fish’ modal type. 13. Selection pressures also operate within behaviour space to maintain and promote the special differences that separate any competitively successful species from all others. Coleoids as a group appear to have retained adaptations associated with such molluscan features as high growth rate and rapid turnover of the population. They are still characteristically crepuscular in habits and have extensive vertical mobility.},

We employ the methodology of reversible‐jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly estimating the support for the hypothesis of correlated evolution. In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution. These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative evolutionary scenarios to explain the observed data. All results are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. We implement the method in a program called RJ Discrete and illustrate it by analyzing the question of whether mating system and advertisement of estrus by females have coevolved in the Old World monkeys and great apes.},

Freshwater habitats ranged from shallow, structurally complex lakes with benthic-foraging stickleback (benthics), to deeper, structurally simple lakes in which stickleback depend more heavily on plankton for prey (generalists). Contrary to our expectations, benthics had smaller telencephala than generalists, but the shape of the telencephalon of the sea-run and benthic populations were more convex laterally. Convex telencephalon shape may indicate enlargement of the dorsolateral region, which is homologous with the tetrapod hippocampus. Telencephalon morphology is also sexually dimorphic, with larger, less convex telencephala in males. Freshwater stickleback from structurally complex habitats have retained the ancestral telencephalon morphology, but populations that feed more in open habitats on plankton have evolved larger, laterally concave telencephala.},

INTRODUCTIONVocal learning, the ability to imitate sounds, is a trait that has undergone convergent evolution in several lineages of birds and mammals, including song-learning birds and humans. This behavior requires cortical and striatal vocal brain regions, which form unique connections in vocal-learning species. These regions have been found to have specialized gene expression within some species, but the patterns of specialization across vocal-learning bird and mammal species have not been systematically explored.

Brain region gene expression specializations were hierarchically organized into specialization trees of each species (blue lines), including for circuits that control learned vocalizations (highlighted green, purple, and orange regions). A set of comparative genomic algorithms found the most similarly specialized regions between songbird and human (orange lines), some of which are convergently evolved.
RATIONALEThe sequencing of genomes representing all major vocal-learning and vocal-nonlearning avian lineages has allowed us to develop the genomic tools to measure anatomical gene expression across species. Here, we asked whether behavioral and anatomical convergence is associated with gene expression convergence in the brains of vocal-learning birds and humans.
RESULTSWe developed a computational approach that discovers homologous and convergent specialized anatomical gene expression profiles. This includes generating hierarchically organized gene expression specialization trees for each species and a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal alignment between species brain trees. We applied this approach to brain region gene expression databases of thousands of samples and genes that we and others generated from multiple species, including humans and song-learning birds (songbird, parrot, and hummingbird) as well as vocal-nonlearning nonhuman primates (macaque) and birds (dove and quail). Our results confirmed the recently revised understanding of the relationships between avian and mammalian brains. We further found that songbird Area X, a striatal region necessary for vocal learning, was most similar to a part of the human striatum activated during speech production. The RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) analog of song-learning birds, necessary for song production, was most similar to laryngeal motor cortex regions in humans that control speech production. More than 50 genes contributed to their convergent specialization and were enriched in motor control and neural connectivity functions. These patterns were not found in vocal nonlearners, but songbird RA was similar to layer 5 of primate motor cortex for another set of genes, supporting previous hypotheses about the similarity of these cell types between bird and mammal brains.
CONCLUSIONOur approach can accurately and quantitatively identify functionally and molecularly analogous brain regions between species separated by as much as 310 million years from a common ancestor. We were able to identify analogous brain regions for song and speech between birds and humans, and broader homologous brain regions in which these specialized song and speech regions are located, for tens to hundreds of genes. These genes now serve as candidates involved in developing and maintaining the unique connectivity and functional properties of vocal-learning brain circuits shared across species. The finding that convergent neural circuits for vocal learning are accompanied by convergent molecular changes of multiple genes in species separated by millions of years from a common ancestor indicates that brain circuits for complex traits may have limited ways in which they could have evolved from that ancestor.
Song-learning birds and humans share independently evolved similarities in brain pathways for vocal learning that are essential for song and speech and are not found in most other species. Comparisons of brain transcriptomes of song-learning birds and humans relative to vocal nonlearners identified convergent gene expression specializations in specific song and speech brain regions of avian vocal learners and humans. The strongest shared profiles relate bird motor and striatal song-learning nuclei, respectively, with human laryngeal motor cortex and parts of the striatum that control speech production and learning. Most of the associated genes function in motor control and brain connectivity. Thus, convergent behavior and neural connectivity for a complex trait are associated with convergent specialized expression of multiple genes.},

Repeated detours starting from within the fence did not help the dogs to obtain the object more quickly if in a subsequent trial they started outside the fence with the object placed inside it. While six trials were not enough for the dogs to show significant improvement on their own in detouring the fence from outside, demonstration of this action by humans significantly improved the dogs' performance within two–three trials. Owners and strangers were equally effective as demonstrators. Our experiments show that dogs are able to rely on information provided by human action when confronted with a new task. While they did not copy the exact path of the human demonstrator, they easily adopted the detour behaviour shown by humans to reach their goal.},

	abstract = {A number of authors have pointed to “convergent evolution” as evidence for the central role of natural selection in shaping predictable trajectories of macroevolution. However, there are numerous conceptual and empirical difficulties that arise in broadly appealing to the frequency of homoplasy as evidence for a non-contingently constrained adaptational design space. Most important is the need to distinguish between convergent (externally constrained) and parallel (internally constrained) evolution, and to consider how the respective frequencies of these significantly different sources of homoplasy affect a strong adaptationist view of life. In this paper, I critically evaluate Simon Conway Morris’s use of the homoplasy literature to support his argument for a non-contingent, counterfactually stable account of macroevolutionary pattern. In so doing, I offer a conception of parallelism which avoids the charge that it differs from convergence merely in degree and not in kind. I argue that although organisms sharing a homoplastic trait will also share varying degrees of homology, it is the underlying developmental homology with respect to the generators directly causally responsible for the homoplastic event that defines parallel evolution and non-arbitrarily distinguishes it from convergence. The notion of “screening-off” is used to distinguish the proximal generators of a homoplastic trait from its more distal genetic causes (such as a master control gene).},

	abstract = {Stephen Jay Gould argued that replaying the ‘tape of life’ would result in radically different evolutionary outcomes. Recently, biologists and philosophers of science have paid increasing attention to the theoretical importance of convergent evolution—the independent origination of similar biological forms and functions—which many interpret as evidence against Gould's thesis. In this paper, we examine the evidentiary relevance of convergent evolution for the radical contingency debate. We show that under the right conditions, episodes of convergent evolution can constitute valid natural experiments that support inferences regarding the deep counterfactual stability of macroevolutionary outcomes. However, we argue that proponents of convergence have problematically lumped causally heterogeneous phenomena into a single evidentiary basket, in effect treating all convergent events as if they are of equivalent theoretical import. As a result, the ‘critique from convergent evolution’ fails to engage with key claims of the radical contingency thesis. To remedy this, we develop ways to break down the heterogeneous set of convergent events based on the nature of the generalizations they support. Adopting this more nuanced approach to convergent evolution allows us to differentiate iterated evolutionary outcomes that are probably common among alternative evolutionary histories and subject to law-like generalizations, from those that do little to undermine and may even support, the Gouldian view of life.},

	abstract = {. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of early experience (rearing conditions) on the central nervous system (CNS) and behavior of spiderlings of Hognacarolinensis (Lycosidae). We were interested in whether or not spiderlings that were allowed to remain in contact with their maternal parent and siblings (enriched condition, EC) would exhibit differences in CNS development or subsequent behavior when compared with those reared in isolation (impoverished condition, IC). Spiderlings emerged from their egg sacs and climbed onto the dorsal surface of their mother's abdomen where they remained until their yolk supply was depleted (5 days). They dispersed on day 6 after emergence. We compared the ability of 16-day-old EC and IC spiderlings to capture prey in a linear runway and to learn a complex maze (spatial learning). We also compared certain aspects of CNS development (brain weight, total number of brain cells, volume of central body and protocerebral neuropil) in EC and IC spiderlings. Results indicated that EC subjects are more efficient at capturing moving prey (crickets) and exhibited improved performance (significantly fewer blind alley errors) in the maze. The volume of the protocerebral neuropil in 6-day-old EC animals increased 30\% over a 5-day period after emergence as compared to IC animals of the same age. The volume of the central body of EC animals increased 34.8\% over the same time period. On day 6 after emergence, the weight of the protocerebrum was significantly greater in EC versus IC subjects. There were no significant effects of rearing condition (EC vs IC) or age (1- and 6-day-old spiderlings) on the total number of nerve cells in the protocerebrum, suggesting that the difference in protocerebral weight was due primarily to differences in supporting glial tissues and neuropil matrix. In conclusion, the data suggest that early contact with the maternal parent and siblings is of vital importance to CNS development in lycosid spiderlings and can influence the capacity for spatial learning as well as the ability to capture prey.},

To assess how processes underlying culture relate to one another and other cognitive capacities, we compiled ecologically relevant cognitive measures from multiple domains, namely reported incidences of behavioural innovation, social learning, tool use, extractive foraging and tactical deception, in 62 primate species. All exhibited strong positive associations in principal component and factor analyses, after statistically controlling for multiple potential confounds. This highly correlated composite of cognitive traits suggests social, technical and ecological abilities have coevolved in primates, indicative of an across-species general intelligence that includes elements of cultural intelligence. Our composite species-level measure of general intelligence, ‘primate gS’, covaried with both brain volume and captive learning performance measures. Our findings question the independence of cognitive traits and do not support ‘massive modularity’ in primate cognition, nor an exclusively social model of primate intelligence. High general intelligence has independently evolved at least four times, with convergent evolution in capuchins, baboons, macaques and great apes.},

Here, we use ecologically relevant measures of cognitive ability, the reported incidence of behavioral innovation, social learning, and tool use, to show that brain size and cognitive capacity are indeed correlated. A comparative analysis of 533 instances of innovation, 445 observations of social learning, and 607 episodes of tool use established that social learning, innovation, and tool use frequencies are positively correlated with species' relative and absolute “executive” brain volumes, after controlling for phylogeny and research effort. Moreover, innovation and social learning frequencies covary across species, in conflict with the view that there is an evolutionary tradeoff between reliance on individual experience and social cues. These findings provide an empirical link between behavioral innovation, social learning capacities, and brain size in mammals. The ability to learn from others, invent new behaviors, and use tools may have played pivotal roles in primate brain evolution.},

We argue that innovation can be used to gauge species differences in behavioral flexibility, and demonstrate that innovation frequency correlates with relative brain size in primates. In the past, hypotheses regarding the ecological causes and consequences of enhanced behavioral flexibility have tended to use brain size as a proxy measure. We discuss the utility of brain size measures for these purposes, and note how innovation frequency may provide a more direct measure of behavioral flexibility. As an illustrative example, we show how innovation and brain size measures allow us to make specific tests of the hypotheses that behavioral flexibility, species range size and environmental variability are linked in primates. En route, we will consider links between innovation and brain evolution, problems and solutions for comparative methods, and discuss what further data would be helpful for testing these ideas. Our overarching aim is to examine the evolutionary causes and consequences of innovative capacities and enhanced brain size in primates.},

Spiders that lose larger larders (i.e., spiders that lose larders consisting of more prey items) search for longer intervals, indicating that the spiders form memories of the size of the prey larders they have accumulated, and use those memories to regulate recovery efforts when the larders are pilfered. Here, we ask whether the spiders represent prey counts (i.e., numerosity) or a continuous integration of prey quantity (mass) in their memories. We manipulated larder sizes in treatments that varied in either prey size or prey numbers but were equivalent in total prey quantity (mass). We then removed the larders to elicit searching and used the spiders’ searching behavior as an assay of their representations in memory. Searching increased with prey quantity (larder size) and did so more steeply with higher prey counts than with single prey of larger sizes. Thus, Nephila spiders seem to track prey quantity in two ways, but to attend more to prey numerosity. We discuss alternatives for continuous accumulator mechanisms that remain to be tested against the numerosity hypothesis, and the evolutionary and adaptive significance of evidence suggestive of numerosity in a sit-and-wait invertebrate predator.},

	abstract = {Environmental conditions may provide specific demands for memory, which in turn may affect specific brain regions responsible for memory function. For food-caching animals, in particular, spatial memory appears to be important because it may have a direct effect on fitness via the accuracy of cache retrieval. Animals living in more harsh environments should rely more on cached food, and thus theoretically should have better memory to support cache retrieval, which may be crucial for survival. Consequently, animals in harsh environments may benefit from more neurons within a larger hippocampus (Hp), a part of the brain involved in spatial memory. Here, we present the first large-scale test of the hypothesis that Hp structure is related to the severity of the environment within a single food-caching species (the black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus) with a large range encompassing a great diversity of climatic conditions. Hp size in birds collected at five locations along a gradient of environmental harshness from Alaska to Kansas ranked perfectly with climatic severity. Birds from more harsh northern climates (defined by lower ambient temperature, shorter day length and more snow cover) had significantly larger Hp volumes and more Hp neurons (both relative to telencephalon volume) than those from more mild southern latitudes. Environmental pressures therefore seem capable of influencing specific brain regions independently, which may result in enhanced memory, and hence survival, in harsh climates.},

Our video recordings enabled an estimate of the species' natural foraging efficiency and revealed that tool use, and choice of tool materials, are more diverse than previously thought. Video tracking has potential for studying the behavior and ecology of many other bird species that are shy or live in inaccessible habitats.

Subject comparison revealed that living in larger groups caused increases in gray matter in mid-superior temporal sulcus and rostral prefrontal cortex and increased coupling of activity in frontal and temporal cortex. Social network size, therefore, contributes to changes both in brain structure and function. The changes have potential implications for an animal’s success in a social context; gray matter differences in similar areas were also correlated with each animal’s dominance within its social network.

Two human-specific amino acid substitutions in the transcription factor forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) are outstanding mechanistic candidates, as they could have been positively selected during human evolution and as FOXP2 is the sole gene to date firmly linked to speech and language development. When these two substitutions are introduced into the endogenous Foxp2 gene of mice (Foxp2hum), cortico-basal ganglia circuits are specifically affected. Here we demonstrate marked effects of this humanization of Foxp2 on learning and striatal neuroplasticity. Foxp2hum/hum mice learn stimulus–response associations faster than their WT littermates in situations in which declarative (i.e., place-based) and procedural (i.e., response-based) forms of learning could compete during transitions toward proceduralization of action sequences. Striatal districts known to be differently related to these two modes of learning are affected differently in the Foxp2hum/hum mice, as judged by measures of dopamine levels, gene expression patterns, and synaptic plasticity, including an NMDA receptor-dependent form of long-term depression. These findings raise the possibility that the humanized Foxp2 phenotype reflects a different tuning of corticostriatal systems involved in declarative and procedural learning, a capacity potentially contributing to adapting the human brain for speech and language acquisition.},

Although animals (particularly tool-users) are capable of solving physical tasks in the laboratory [1–7], the degree to which they understand them in terms of their underlying physical forces is a matter of contention. Here, using a new paradigm, the two-trap tube task, we report the performance of non-tool-using rooks. In contrast to the low success rates of previous studies using trap-tube problems [1–4], seven out of eight rooks solved the initial task, and did so rapidly. Instead of the usual, conceptually flawed [8] control, we used a series of novel transfer tasks to test for understanding. All seven transferred their solution across a change in stimuli. However, six out of seven were unable to transfer to two further tasks, which did not share any one visual constant. One female was able to solve these further transfer tasks. Her result is suggestive evidence that rooks are capable of sophisticated physical cognition, if not through an understanding of unobservable forces [3, 9], perhaps through rule abstraction. Our results highlight the need to investigate cognitive mechanisms other than causal understanding in studying animal physical cognition.},

For example, when 4-year-old children pass a test requiring them to communicate the content of another's falsely held belief, while 3-year-olds fail, we know that something must change over the course of the third year of life. In the search for what develops or evolves, the typical route is to probe the extents and limits of successful individuals' ability. Another is to focus on those that failed, and find out what difference or lack prevented them from passing the task. Recent research in developmental psychology has harnessed individual differences to illuminate the cognitive mechanisms that emerge to enable success. We apply this approach to explaining some of the failures made by chimpanzees when using tools to solve problems. Twelve of 16 chimpanzees failed to discriminate between a complete and a broken tool when, after being set down, the ends of the broken one were aligned in front of them. There was a correlation between performance on this aligned task and another in which after being set down, the centre of both tools was covered, suggesting that the limiting factor was not the representation of connection, but memory or attention. Some chimpanzees that passed the aligned task passed a task in which the location of the broken tool was never visible but had to be inferred.},

	abstract = {Choice by exclusion involves selecting a rewarded stimulus by rejecting alternatives that are unlikely to be rewarded. It has been proposed that in corvids, exclusion is an adaptive specialization for caching that, together with object permanence and observational spatial memory, enhances a bird’s ability to keep track of the contents of caches. Thus, caching species are predicted to perform well in tasks requiring exclusion. We tested this prediction by assessing the performance of Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), a highly specialized cacher, in a two-way object choice task in which food was hidden in 1 of 2 cups. Consistent with the corvids’ capacity for observational spatial memory, jays were highly accurate when shown the location of the food reward. However, the jays failed to exclude the empty cup when shown its contents. This failure to select the baited cup when shown the empty cup was possibly due to jays attending to the experimenter’s movements and erroneously selecting the empty cup by responding to these local enhancement cues. To date, no corvids have been tested in an auditory two-way object choice task. Testing exclusion in the auditory domain requires that a bird use the noise produced when the baited cup is shaken to locate the reward. Although jays chose the baited cup more frequently than predicted by chance, their performance did not differ from trials controlling for the use of conflicting cues provided by the experimenter. Overall, our results provide little support for the hypothesis that caching has shaped exclusion abilities in corvids.},

Modern comparative studies have proposed their diversity, origins, and basic functionality across animal phyla. Despite a number of attempts, however, a common functional plan of the complex brain remains controversial. For example, there is currently no prominent theory of how neural networks are structurally comparable between phylogenetically distant animals such as vertebrates, octopuses, worms, and insects, in which there are distinguishably different brain architectures. This chapter attempts to identify the types of information flow patterns that were specialized during brain evolution, when these patterns appeared as a prototype, and how the flow systems have been shaped based on the common morphological architecture. In a notable case, a number of sensory associative centers show comparable patterns in mammalian, insect, and octopus brains, representing a common input and output flow of information. One can speculate that a common underlying structure is shared between various animals because of common functionalities that produce highly effective learning, memory, and autonomous cognitive tasks. Such an underlying structure could help establish a large-scale framework for comparison between phylogenetically distant animal brains and perhaps even form the groundwork for artificial general intelligence.},

These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

In birds, nesting habits, sexually selected traits, migration, clutch size and body mass have been suggested as important variables, but behavioural flexibility is another obvious trait that has received little attention. Behavioural flexibility allows animals to respond more rapidly to environmental changes and can therefore be advantageous when invading novel habitats. Behavioural flexibility is linked to relative brain size and, for foraging, has been operationalised as the number of innovations per taxon reported in the short note sections of ornithology journals. Here, we use data on avian species introduced to New Zealand and test the link between forebrain size, feeding innovation frequency and invasion success. Relative brain size was, as expected, a significant predictor of introduction success, after removing the effect of introduction effort. Species with relatively larger brains tended to be better invaders than species with smaller ones. Introduction effort, migratory strategy and mode of juvenile development were also significant in the models. Pair-wise comparisons of closely related species indicate that successful invaders also showed a higher frequency of foraging innovations in their region of origin. This study provides the first evidence in vertebrates of a general set of traits, behavioural flexibility, that can potentially favour invasion success.},

In this study, we examined introduction success of 69 bird species in different regions of the world as a function of their degree of behavioural flexibility. Specifically, we predicted that species with relatively large brains and a high frequency of foraging innovations in their area of origin should show a higher probability of establishing themselves where they were introduced than species with small brains and low innovation frequencies. An analysis with general linear modelling (GLM) supported the prediction for relative brain size, even when controlling for phylogenetic biases and potential confounding variables. The only covariates that remained with relative brain size were plumage dimorphism, human commensalism and nest site. A pairwise comparison of closely related species also revealed that successful invaders showed a higher frequency of foraging innovations in their region of origin. This result held even when differences in research effort between species were considered.

Similarities of brain structure, function, and behavior are usually ascribed to convergent evolution. In their review, Strausfeld and Hirth (p. 157) identify multiple commonalities shared by vertebrate basal ganglia and a system of forebrain centers in arthropods called the central complex. The authors conclude that circuits essential to behavioral choice originated very early across phyla.
The arthropod central complex and vertebrate basal ganglia derive from embryonic basal forebrain lineages that are specified by an evolutionarily conserved genetic program leading to interconnected neuropils and nuclei that populate the midline of the forebrain-midbrain boundary region. In the substructures of both the central complex and basal ganglia, network connectivity and neuronal activity mediate control mechanisms in which inhibitory (GABAergic) and modulatory (dopaminergic) circuits facilitate the regulation and release of adaptive behaviors. Both basal ganglia and central complex dysfunction result in behavioral defects including motor abnormalities, impaired memory formation, attention deficits, affective disorders, and sleep disturbances. The observed multitude of similarities suggests deep homology of arthropod central complex and vertebrate basal ganglia circuitries underlying the selection and maintenance of behavioral actions.},

Here, we used data for 35 species and six genes (4.8 kb) for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships between Spartaeinae, Lyssomaninae and Salticoida. We document a remarkable case of morphological convergence of eye ultrastructure in two clades with divergent predatory behaviour. We, furthermore, find evidence for a stepwise, gradual evolution of a complex predatory strategy. Divergent predatory behaviour ranges from cursorial hunting to building prey-catching webs and araneophagy with web invasion and aggressive mimicry. Web invasion and aggressive mimicry evolved once from an ancestral spartaeine that was already araneophagic and had no difficulty entering webs due to glue immunity. Web invasion and aggressive mimicry was lost once, in Paracyrba, which has replaced one highly specialized predation strategy with another (hunting mosquitoes). In contrast to the evolution of divergent behaviour, eyes with similarly high spatial acuity and ultrastructural design evolved convergently in the Salticoida and in Portia.},

	abstract = {Summary
One of the key problems in motor control is mastering or reducing the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) through coordination [1]. This problem is especially prominent with hyper-redundant limbs such as the extremely flexible arm of the octopus [2]. Several strategies for simplifying these control problems have been suggested for human point-to-point arm movements [3–6]. Despite the evolutionary gap and morphological differences, humans and octopuses evolved similar strategies when fetching food to the mouth. To achieve this precise point-to-point-task, octopus arms generate a quasi-articulated structure based on three dynamic joints. A rotational movement around these joints brings the object to the mouth [7]. Here, we describe a peripheral neural mechanism—two waves of muscle activation propagate toward each other, and their collision point sets the medial-joint location. This is a remarkably simple mechanism for adjusting the length of the segments according to where the object is grasped. Furthermore, similar to certain human arm movements, kinematic invariants were observed at the joint level rather than at the end-effector level, suggesting intrinsic control coordination. The evolutionary convergence to similar geometrical and kinematic features suggests that a kinematically constrained articulated limb controlled at the level of joint space is the optimal solution for precise point-to-point movements.},

An analysis of scanning showed that, at the beginning of the scanning routine, the spiders scanned both the complete and the incomplete route but that, by the end of the scanning routine, they predominantly scanned only the complete route. Two rules seemed to govern their scanning: (1) they would continue turning in one direction when scanning away from the lure along horizontal features of the detour route; and (2) when the end of the horizontal feature being scanned was reached, they would change direction and turn back towards the lure. These rules ‘channelled’ the spiders' scanning on to the complete route, and they then overwhelmingly chose to head towards the route they had fixated most while scanning.},

	abstract = {Darwin's finches are a classic example of adaptive radiation. The ecological diversity of the Galápagos in part explains that radiation, but the fact that other founder species did not radiate suggests that other factors are also important. One hypothesis attempting to identify the extra factor is the flexible stem hypothesis, connecting individual adaptability to species richness. According to this hypothesis, the ancestral finches were flexible and therefore able to adapt to the new and harsh environment they encountered by exploiting new food types and developing new foraging techniques. Phenotypic variation was initially mediated by learning, but genetic accommodation entrenched differences and supplemented them with morphological adaptations. This process subsequently led to diversification and speciation of the Darwin's finches. Their current behaviour is consistent with this hypothesis as these birds use unusual resources by extraordinary means. In this paper, we identify cognitive capacities on which flexibility and innovation depend. The flexible stem hypothesis predicts that we will find high levels of these capacities in all species of Darwin's finches (not just those using innovative techniques). Here, we test that prediction, and find that while most of our data are in line with the flexible stem hypothesis, some are in tension with it.},

Studies often focus on a subset of high-performing subjects, sometimes viewing evidence from a single individual as sufficient to demonstrate the cognitive capacity of a species. We argue that the emphasis on demonstrating species-level cognitive capacities detracts from the value of individual variation in understanding cognitive development and evolution. We consider developmental and evolutionary interpretations of individual variation and use meta-analyses of data from published studies to examine predictors of individual performance. We show that reliance on small sample sizes precludes robust conclusions about individual abilities as well as inter- and intraspecific differences. We advocate standardization of experimental protocols and pooling of data between laboratories to improve statistical rigour. Our analyses show that cognitive performance is influenced by age, sex, rearing conditions and previous experience. These effects limit the validity of comparative analyses unless developmental histories are taken into account, and complicate attempts to understand how cognitive traits are expressed and selected under natural conditions. Further understanding of cognitive evolution requires efforts to elucidate the heritability of cognitive traits and establish whether elevated cognitive performance confers fitness advantages in nature.},

However, as innovations are rarely observed in nature, their emergence is poorly understood. What drives individuals to innovate, and what psychological mechanisms allow them to do so? We used three novel food extraction tasks to address these questions in groups of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Innovatory tendencies were unrelated to body condition and foraging success, but were affected by age, rank and sex. Juvenile individuals were most likely to interact with tasks, but seldom solved them, perhaps owing to their small size or lack of dexterity. Instead, adult subordinates made up the bulk of the innovators. In cooperatively breeding societies, the inability of subordinate helpers to compete physically with dominant breeders may drive them to seek out solutions to novel problems. Most innovators were males, which, as the dispersing sex, may be particularly prone to solve novel problems, and innovators virtually always persisted longer than other group members when interacting with tasks. Most successful individuals solved tasks more than once, and learned to inhibit ineffective prepotent responses across successive presentations of the same task. They did not learn to manipulate functional parts of the apparatus more efficiently, however, nor did they extract general rules allowing them to solve novel tasks faster. Contrary to recent suggestions that innovation may be cognitively demanding, these results suggest that simple, conserved learning processes and dogged perseverance may suffice to generate solutions to novel problems.},

The evolution of the highest-order human brain center, the “pallium” or “cortex,” remains enigmatic. To elucidate its origins, we set out to identify related brain parts in phylogenetically distant animals, to then unravel common aspects in cellular composition and molecular architecture. Here, we compare vertebrate pallium development to that of the mushroom bodies, sensory-associative brain centers, in an annelid. Using a newly developed protocol for cellular profiling by image registration (PrImR), we obtain a high-resolution gene expression map for the developing annelid brain. Comparison to the vertebrate pallium reveals that the annelid mushroom bodies develop from similar molecular coordinates within a conserved overall molecular brain topology and that their development involves conserved patterning mechanisms and produces conserved neuron types that existed already in the protostome-deuterostome ancestors. These data indicate deep homology of pallium and mushroom bodies and date back the origin of higher brain centers to prebilaterian times.},

	abstract = {Large brains are thought to result from selection for cognitive benefits, but how enhanced cognition leads to increased fitness remains poorly understood. One explanation is that increased cognitive ability results in improved monitoring and assessment of predator threats. Here, we use male and female guppies (Poecilia reticulata), artificially selected for large and small brain size, to provide an experimental evaluation of this hypothesis. We examined their behavioural response as singletons, pairs or shoals of four towards a model predator. Large-brained females, but not males, spent less time performing predator inspections, an inherently risky behaviour. Video analysis revealed that large-brained females were further away from the model predator when in pairs but that they habituated quickly towards the model when in shoals of four. Males stayed further away from the predator model than females but again we found no brain size effect in males. We conclude that differences in brain size affect the female predator response. Large-brained females might be able to assess risk better or need less sensory information to reach an accurate conclusion. Our results provide experimental support for the general idea that predation pressure is likely to be important for the evolution of brain size in prey species.},

	abstract = {If social learning is more efficient than independent individual exploration, animals should learn vital cultural skills exclusively, and routine skills faster, through social learning, provided they actually use social learning preferentially. Animals with opportunities for social learning indeed do so. Moreover, more frequent opportunities for social learning should boost an individual's repertoire of learned skills. This prediction is confirmed by comparisons among wild great ape populations and by social deprivation and enculturation experiments. These findings shaped the cultural intelligence hypothesis, which complements the traditional benefit hypotheses for the evolution of intelligence by specifying the conditions in which these benefits can be reaped. The evolutionary version of the hypothesis argues that species with frequent opportunities for social learning should more readily respond to selection for a greater number of learned skills. Because improved social learning also improves asocial learning, the hypothesis predicts a positive interspecific correlation between social-learning performance and individual learning ability. Variation among primates supports this prediction. The hypothesis also predicts that more heavily cultural species should be more intelligent. Preliminary tests involving birds and mammals support this prediction too. The cultural intelligence hypothesis can also account for the unusual cognitive abilities of humans, as well as our unique mechanisms of skill transfer.},

Second, it cannot account for the observation that species with high socio-cognitive abilities also excel in general cognition. These problems may be related.

	abstract = {Expansion of the cortical grey matter in evolution has been accompanied by an even faster expansion of the subcortical white matter volume and by folding of the grey matter surface, events traditionally considered to occur homogeneously across mammalian species. Here we investigate how white matter expansion and cortical folding scale across species of rodents and primates as the grey matter gains neurons. We find very different scaling rules of white matter expansion across the two orders, favoring volume conservation and smaller propagation times in primates. For a similar number of cortical neurons, primates have a smaller connectivity fraction and less white matter volume than rodents; moreover, as the cortex gains neurons, there is a much faster increase in white matter volume and in its ratio to grey matter volume in rodents than in primates. Order-specific scaling of the white matter can be attributed to different scaling of average fiber caliber and neuronal connectivity in rodents and primates. Finally, cortical folding increases as different functions of the number of cortical neurons in rodents and primates, scaling faster in the latter than in the former. While the neuronal rules that govern grey and white matter scaling are different across rodents and primates, we find that they can be explained by the same unifying model, with order-specific exponents. The different scaling of the white matter has implications for the scaling of propagation time and computational capacity in evolution, and calls for a reappraisal of developmental models of cortical expansion in evolution.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

It is unclear how the environment influences natural variation in heritable behaviour, and whether complex behavioural differences evolve through few genetic changes, each affecting many aspects of behaviour, or through the accumulation of several genetic changes that, when combined, give rise to behavioural complexity. Here we show that in nature, oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus) build complex burrows with long entrance and escape tunnels, and that burrow length is consistent across populations, although burrow depth varies with soil composition. This burrow architecture is in contrast with the small, simple burrows of its sister species, deer mice (P. maniculatus). When investigated under laboratory conditions, both species recapitulate their natural burrowing behaviour. Genetic crosses between the two species reveal that the derived burrows of oldfield mice are dominant and evolved through the addition of multiple genetic changes. In burrows built by first-generation backcross mice, entrance-tunnel length and the presence of an escape tunnel can be uncoupled, suggesting that these traits are modular. Quantitative trait locus analysis also indicates that tunnel length segregates as a complex trait, affected by at least three independent genetic regions, whereas the presence of an escape tunnel is associated with only a single locus. Together, these results suggest that complex behaviours—in this case, a classic /`extended phenotype/'—can evolve through multiple genetic changes each affecting distinct behaviour modules.},

Antibodies against these proteins resolve forebrain centres, or their equivalents, having the same ground pattern of neuronal organization in species across five phyla. The ground pattern is defined by olfactory or chemosensory afferents supplying systems of parallel fibres of intrinsic neurons intersected by orthogonal domains of afferent and efferent arborizations with local interneurons providing feedback loops.

The goal of this work is to describe heterochronic changes in brain evolution within its basic developmental allometry, and provide an empirical basis to recognize equivalent maturational states across animals. The empirical data generating the model comprises 271 developmental events, including measures of initial neurogenesis, axon extension, establishment, and refinement of connectivity, as well as later events such as myelin formation, growth of brain volume, and early behavioral milestones, to the third year of human postnatal life. The progress of neural events across species is sufficiently predictable that a single model can be used to predict the timing of all events in all species, with a correlation of modeled values to empirical data of 0.9929. Each species' rate of progress through the event scale, described by a regression equation predicting duration of development in days, is highly correlated with adult brain size. Neural heterochrony can be seen in selective delay of retinogenesis in the cat, associated with greater numbers of rods in its retina, and delay of corticogenesis in all species but rodents and the rabbit, associated with relatively larger cortices in species with delay. Unexpectedly, precocial mammals (those unusually mature at birth) delay the onset of first neurogenesis but then progress rapidly through remaining developmental events.},

The result is notable because, for more than 100 years, many biologists have believed that birds are more uniform anatomically than other classes of vertebrates. Furthermore, assessment of biochemical and geological evidence suggests that the time scale for bird evolution could be quite short. Hence, birds may share with placental mammals the distinction of having had a high rate of anatomical evolution, compared to that in lower vertebrates. The rate appears to have been very high in songbirds and higher primates and extremely high in the genus Homo. In an attempt to explain such contrasts in rates of anatomical evolution, we advance the hypothesis that in higher vertebrates, behavior, rather than environmental change, is the major driving force for evolution at the organismal level. This hypothesis predicts accelerated anatomical evolution in species composed of numerous mobile individuals with the dual capacity for behavioral innovation and social propagation of new habits. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate a correlation between relative brain size and rate of anatomical evolution in land vertebrates.},

	abstract = {The robustness and plasticity of working memory were investigated in honey bees by using a delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) paradigm. The findings are summarized as follows: first, performance in the DMTS task decreases as the duration between the presentation of the sample stimulus and the presentation of the comparison stimuli is increased. This decrease is well approximated by an exponential decay function. Performance is significantly better than random-choice level even at delays as long as 5 sec and is reduced to random-choice levels at an average delay time of 8.68 ± 0.06 sec. Second, when the DMTS task involves two samples (one relevant, the other irrelevant), bees can be trained to learn to use the relevant sample to perform the task if (i) the relevant sample is always at a fixed position, or (ii) the relevant sample always has the same place in the sequence of presentation (always first or always second). Bees that have learned to use the relevant sample and to ignore the irrelevant sample can generalize this learning, and apply it to novel sets of sample and comparison stimuli that they have never previously encountered. The findings point to a remarkably robust, and yet plastic, working memory in the honey bee.},

This review emphasizes the importance of complete, serially sectioned human brains of different ontogenetic stages as well as those of adult and old human individuals for neurobiological and medical research. Such histological sections enable microstructural analyses and anatomical evaluations of functional and structural neuroimaging data, for example, based on magnetic resonance imaging. Here, this review provides the first detailed and updated account of the content of the Stephan, Zilles, and Zilles-Amunts collections, which consist of serially sectioned and cell body- and myelin-stained histological preparations. Finally, this reivew will give an overview of past and recent research using these collections to increase our understanding of the detailed patterns of divergent brain evolution in primates as well as of the structural organization of the human brain.},

	abstract = {There is remarkable diversity in brain anatomy among vertebrates and evidence is accumulating that predatory interactions are crucially important for this diversity. To test this hypothesis, we collected female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from 16 wild populations and related their brain anatomy to several aspects of predation pressure in this ecosystem, such as the biomass of the four major predators of guppies (one prawn and three fish species), and predator diversity (number of predatory fish species in each site). We found that populations from localities with higher prawn biomass had relatively larger telencephalon size as well as larger brains. Optic tectum size was positively associated with one of the fish predator’s biomass and with overall predator diversity. However, both olfactory bulb and hypothalamus size were negatively associated with the biomass of another of the fish predators. Hence, while fish predator occurrence is associated with variation in brain anatomy, prawn occurrence is associated with variation in brain size. Our results suggest that cognitive challenges posed by local differences in predator communities may lead to changes in prey brain anatomy in the wild.},

Review of published ecological studies using path analysis suggests that path analysis is often misused and collinearity is a moderate to severe problem in a majority of the analyses. 2. Multiple regression is shown to be related to path analysis, and thus collinearity, which is a well-known problem in regression analysis, can also be a problem in path analysis. Collinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated and causes estimates of standardized partial regression coefficients and of path coefficients to be less precise, less accurate and prone to rounding error. 3. A review of 24 path analyses in 12 papers revealed incorrectly calculated path coefficients in 13 cases and problems with collinearity in 15 cases. Estimates of path coefficients are biased and lack precision if there is collinearity. 4. An additional 40 path analyses could not be evaluated because of incomplete information. Most studies lack sufficient sample size to justify the use of path analysis. Problems associated with the use of categorical variables, which were used in six cases, are unappreciated. 5. These problems suggest that path coefficients may often mislead ecologists about the relative importance of ecological processes.},

However, relatively little is known of the early evolutionary history of the hyperinflated brain that distinguishes birds from other living reptiles and provides the important neurological capablities required by flight. Here we use high-resolution computed tomography to estimate and compare cranial volumes of extant birds, the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica, and a number of non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs that are phylogenetically close to the origins of both Avialae and avian flight. Previous work established that avian cerebral expansion began early in theropod history and that the cranial cavity of Archaeopteryx was volumetrically intermediate between these early forms and modern birds. Our new data indicate that the relative size of the cranial cavity of Archaeopteryx is reflective of a more generalized maniraptoran volumetric signature and in several instances is actually smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs. Thus, bird-like encephalization indices evolved multiple times, supporting the conclusion that if Archaeopteryx had the neurological capabilities required of flight, so did at least some other non-avian maniraptorans. This is congruent with recent findings that avialans were not unique among maniraptorans in their ability to fly in some form.},

	abstract = {Living birds constitute the only vertebrate group whose brain volume relative to body size approaches the uniquely expanded values expressed by mammals. The broad suite of complex behaviors exhibited by crown-group birds, including sociality, vocal learning, parental care, and flying, suggests the origins of their encephalization was likely driven by a mosaic of selective pressures. If true, the historical pattern of brain expansion may be more complex than either a gradual expansion, as proposed by early studies of the avian brain, or a sudden expansion correlating with the appearance of flight. The origins of modern avian neuroanatomy are obscured by the more than 100 million years of evolution along their phylogenetic stem (from the origin of the modern radiation in the Middle Jurassic to the split from crocodile-line archosaurs). Here we use phylogenetic comparative approaches to explore which evolutionary scenarios best explain variation in measured volumes of digitally partitioned endocasts of modern birds and their non-avian ancestors. Our analyses suggest that variation in the relative volumes of the endocranium and cerebrum explain most of the structural variation in this lineage. Generalized multi-regime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models suggest that powered flight does not appear to be a driver of observed variation, reinforcing the hypothesis that the deep history of the avian brain is complex, with nuances still to be discovered.},

Cognitive evolution has been explained at the proximate level by shifts in absolute and relative brain volume and at the ultimate level by differences in social and dietary complexity. However, no study has integrated the experimental and phylogenetic approach at the scale required to rigorously test these explanations. Instead, previous research has largely relied on various measures of brain size as proxies for cognitive abilities. We experimentally evaluated these major evolutionary explanations by quantitatively comparing the cognitive performance of 567 individuals representing 36 species on two problem-solving tasks measuring self-control. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that absolute brain volume best predicted performance across species and accounted for considerably more variance than brain volume controlling for body mass. This result corroborates recent advances in evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the cognitive consequences of cortical reorganization through increases in brain volume. Within primates, dietary breadth but not social group size was a strong predictor of species differences in self-control. Our results implicate robust evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth, absolute brain volume, and self-control. These findings provide a significant first step toward quantifying the primate cognitive phenome and explaining the process of cognitive evolution.},

Although such behavioural flexibility is regularly observed in the field, it has proven difficult to systematically quantify and predict inter-individual differences in free-living animals. We presented 24 Zenaida doves (Zenaida aurita) on 12 territories with two learning tests in their natural habitat in Barbados. The dove pairs showed high site fidelity and territoriality, allowing us to test individuals repeatedly while accounting for the effects of territorial chases and pair bonds on our learning measures. We used a foraging apparatus that enabled Zenaida doves to access seed, yet excluded other species, and measured doves’ performance on colour discrimination and reversal learning tests. We found that (1) doves on all 12 territories passed the two tests; (2) mates within a pair were consistently solvers or scroungers; (3) sex, body condition and territorial chases did not consistently affect learning rates; (4) tameness was a significant negative predictor of learning to feed from the foraging apparatus and (5) scrounging within pairs seemed to facilitate learning.

It is known, however, that food-storing birds remember the spatial location and contents of their caches. Furthermore, food-storing animals adapt their caching and recovery strategies to the perishability of food stores, which suggests that they are sensitive to temporal factors. Here we show that scrub jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) remember 'when' food items are stored by allowing them to recover perishable 'wax worms' (wax-moth larvae) and non-perishable peanuts which they had previously cached in visuospatially distinct sites. Jays searched preferentially for fresh wax worms, their favoured food, when allowed to recover them shortly after caching. However, they rapidly learned to avoid searching for worms after a longer interval during which the worms had decayed. The recovery preference of jays demonstrates memory of where and when particular food items were cached, thereby fulfilling the behavioural criteria for episodic-like memory in non-human animals.},

For understanding why the aggressive mimic's signals work, it is important to appreciate that these signals interface with the prey's perceptual system, and that the aggressive mimic can be envisaged as playing mind games with its prey. Examples of aggressive mimicry vary from instances in which specifying a model is straight forward to instances where a concise characterization of the model is difficult. However, the less straightforward examples of aggressive mimicry may be the more interesting examples in the context of animal cognition. In particular, there are spiders that prey on other spiders by entering their prey's web and making signals. Web invasion brings about especially intimate contact with their prey's perceptual system because the prey spider's web is an important component of the prey spider's sensory apparatus. For the web-invading spider, often there is also a large element of risk when practising aggressive mimicry because the intended prey is also a potential predator. This element of risk, combined with exceptionally intimate interfacing with prey perceptual systems, may have favoured the web-invading aggressive mimic's strategy becoming strikingly cognitive in character. Yet a high level of flexibility may be widespread among aggressive mimics in general and, on the whole, we propose that research on aggressive mimicry holds exceptional potential for advancing our understanding of animal cognition.},

Second, single encounters are sufficient for forming search images. Third, search images are based on selective attention specifically to optical cues. Fourth, there are trade-offs in attention during search-image use (i.e., forming a search image for one type of spider diminishes the araneophagic salticid’s attention to other spiders). Fifth, the araneophagic salticid’s adoption of search images is costly to the prey (i.e., when the araneophagic salticid adopts a search, the prey’s prospects for surviving encounters with the araneophagic salticid are diminished).

Predatory strategies, including foraging decisions, prey preferences and predatory versatility, have also been emphasized in the recent literature. The present paper is concerned with both of these areas, parental care and predatory strategies. Scytodes sp. indet. is a versatile predator that captures prey either in its web or away from webs, and prey capture may be either by ambush or by active pursuit regardless of whether in the presence and absence of webs. The web is a sparsely woven sheet across a concave upper leaf surface, with a three-dimensional tubular nest linked to the sheet via a small opening. Leaves may be green and living or brown and dead. In the field, a wide range of insects and spiders is taken, but jumping spiders (Salticidae) are the dominant prey. Predatory attacks are by spitting, with large prey being spat at repeatedly before being subdued. After spitting, the scytodid wraps prey in silk before feeding. Eggs are enclosed in a silk egg sac. The female uses her chelicerae to hold her eggs until hatching. After hatching, there is an extended mother–offspring association, with juveniles tending to remain in their mother's web until after the third moult. Females take prey to their juveniles and either feed alongside the juveniles or leave the juveniles to feed alone.},

The H and AT transplants were found to be growing partially within the Hf and partially within the underlying ventricle. The transplants appeared healthy and contained neurons with beaded and unbeaded fibers (shown by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to parvalbumin, substance P, and a 200 kDa neurofilament protein). Blood vessels and erythrocytes were also present within the transplants. The results show that neural transplants can survive within the bird brain and that small lesions of the Hf produce significant spatial memory deficits that can only be reversed by surviving homologous H transplants, and not by heterologous telencephalon transplants.},

Here we investigated to what extent the pattern of spread of innovations in captive groups of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, could be predicted by knowledge of individual and social group variables, including association patterns, social rank orders, measures of neophobia and asocial learning performance. We presented small groups of starlings with a series of novel extractive foraging tasks and recorded the latency for each bird to contact and solve each task, as well as the orders of contacting and solving. We then explored which variables best predicted the observed diffusion patterns. Object neophobia and social rank measures characterized who was the first of the group to contact the novel foraging tasks, and the subsequent spread of contacting tasks was associated with latency to feed in a novel environment. Asocial learning performance, measured in isolation, predicted who was the first solver of the novel foraging tasks in each group. Association patterns did not predict the spread of solving. Contact latency and solving duration were negatively correlated, consistent with social learning underlying the spread of solving. Our findings indicate that we can improve our understanding of the diffusion dynamics of innovations in animal groups by investigating group-dependent and individual variables in combination. We introduce novel methods for exploring predictors of the origin and spread of behavioural innovations that could be widely applied.},

We examined the relationship between primate brain size and both technical (i.e. tool using) and non-technical innovation, deploying a combination of phylogenetically informed regression and exploratory causal graph analyses. Regression analyses revealed that absolute and relative brain size correlated positively with technical innovation, and exhibited consistently weaker, but still positive, relationships with non-technical innovation. These findings mirror similar results in birds. Our exploratory causal graph analyses suggested that technical innovation shares strong direct relationships with brain size, body size, social learning rate and social group size, whereas non-technical innovation did not exhibit a direct relationship with brain size. Nonetheless, non-technical innovation was linked to brain size indirectly via diet and life-history variables. Our findings support ‘technical intelligence’ hypotheses in linking technical innovation to encephalization in the restricted set of primate lineages where technical innovation has been reported. Our findings also provide support for a broad co-evolving complex of brain, behaviour, life-history, social and dietary variables, providing secondary support for social and ecological intelligence hypotheses. The ability to gain access to difficult-to-extract, but potentially nutrient-rich, resources through tool use may have conferred on some primates adaptive advantages, leading to selection for brain circuitry that underlies technical proficiency.},

However, though relatively small, the cerebellum contains about four times more neurons than the neocortex. I show that commonly used comparative measures such as neocortex ratio underestimate the contribution of the cerebellum to brain evolution. Once differences in the scaling of connectivity in neocortex and cerebellum are accounted for, a marked and general pattern of correlated evolution of the two structures is apparent. One deviation from this general pattern is a relative expansion of the cerebellum in apes and other extractive foragers. The confluence of these comparative patterns, studies of ape foraging skills and social learning, and recent evidence on the cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum, suggest an important role for the cerebellum in the evolution of the capacity for planning, execution and understanding of complex behavioural sequences—including tool use and language. There is no clear separation between sensory–motor and cognitive specializations underpinning such skills, undermining the notion of executive control as a distinct process. Instead, I argue that cognitive evolution is most effectively understood as the elaboration of specialized systems for embodied adaptive control.},

These patterns have been explained in terms of developmental costs (larger brains take longer to grow) and cognitive benefits (large brains enhance survival and increase lifespan). In support of the developmental cost hypothesis, we show that evolutionary changes in pre- and postnatal brain growth correlate specifically with duration of the relevant phases of maternal investment (gestation and lactation, respectively). We also find support for the hypothesis that the rate of fetal brain growth is related to the energy turnover of the mother. In contrast, we find no support for hypotheses proposing that costs are accommodated through direct tradeoffs between brain and body growth, or between brain growth and litter size. When the duration of maternal investment is taken into account, adult brain size is uncorrelated with other life history traits such as lifespan. Hence, the general pattern of slower life histories in large-brained species appears to be a direct consequence of developmental costs.},

Yet, despite more than 100 years of research, the ecological conditions that select for changes in brain size are unclear. Recent laboratory selection experiments showed that selection for larger brains is associated with increased survival in risky environments. Such results lead to the prediction that increased predation should favour increased brain size. Work on natural populations, however, foreshadows the opposite trajectory of evolution; increased predation favours increased boldness, slower learning, and may thereby select for a smaller brain. We tested the influence of predator-induced mortality on brain size evolution by quantifying brain size variation in a Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus hartii, from communities that differ in predation intensity. We observed strong genetic differences in male (but not female) brain size between fish communities; second generation laboratory-reared males from sites with predators exhibited smaller brains than Rivulus from sites in which they are the only fish present. Such trends oppose the results of recent laboratory selection experiments and are not explained by trade-offs with other components of fitness. Our results suggest that increased male brain size is favoured in less risky environments because of the fitness benefits associated with faster rates of learning and problem-solving behaviour.},

	abstract = {Charles Darwin famously concluded On the Origin of Species with a vision of "endless forms most beautiful" continually evolving. More than 150 years later many evolutionary biologists see not endless forms but the same, or very similar, forms evolving repeatedly in many independent species lineages. A porpoise's fishlike fins, for example, are not inherited from fish ancestors but are independently derived convergent traits. In this book, George McGhee describes the ubiquity of the phenomenon of convergent evolution and connects it directly to the concept of evolutionary constraint--the idea that the number of evolutionary pathways available to life are not endless, but quite limited. Convergent evolution occurs on all levels, from tiny organic molecules to entire ecosystems of species. McGhee demonstrates its ubiquity in animals, both herbivore and carnivore; in plants; in ecosystems; in molecules, including DNA, proteins, and enzymes; and even in minds, describing problem-solving behavior and group behavior as the products of convergence. For each species example, he provides an abbreviated list of the major nodes in its phylogenetic classification, allowing the reader to see the evolutionary relationship of a group of species that have independently evolved a similar trait by convergent evolution. McGhee analyzes the role of functional and developmental constraints in producing convergent evolution, and considers the scientific and philosophical implications of convergent evolution for the predictability of the evolutionary process.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that microcephaly genes contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in brain mass across anthropoid primates using a comparative approach.

Although data are compiled from species in which the timing of birth and the rate of maturation vary widely, the model proves statistically accurate, with practical implications for improving estimation of milestones of neural development, particularly for humans.
Using the three-factor model (species, neural events, and primate adjustments), we produce predictions for the timing of 493 neural occurrences in developing mammalian brains that either have not yet been, or cannot be, empirically derived. We also relate the timing of neural events across the nine species in the form of a reference table calibrated to the development of laboratory rats. This ‘translation’ table will assist in attempts to equate the neurodevelopmental literature across species with either large or small differences in gestation and maturation, and also permit studies done in a variety of mammals to be applied to better understand human development.

Comparison of multiple regressions on allometric data for 131 mammalian species, however, suggests that for 9 of 11 brain structures taxonomic and body size factors are less important than covariance of these major structures with each other. Which structure grows biggest is largely predicted by a conserved order of neurogenesis that can be derived from the basic axial structure of the developing brain. This conserved order of neurogenesis predicts the relative scaling not only of gross brain regions like the isocortex or mesencephalon, but also the level of detail of individual thalamic nuclei. Special selection of particular areas for specific functions does occur, but it is a minor factor compared to the large-scale covariance of the whole brain. The idea that enlarged isocortex could be a “spandrel,” a by-product of structural constraints later adapted for various behaviors, contrasts with approaches to selection of particular brain regions for cognitively advanced uses, as is commonly assumed in the case of hominid brain evolution.},

Humans’ unique cognitive abilities are usually attributed to a greatly expanded neocortex, which has been described as “the crowning achievement of evolution and the biological substrate of human mental prowess” [1]. The human cerebellum, however, contains four times more neurons than the neocortex [2] and is attracting increasing attention for its wide range of cognitive functions. Using a method for detecting evolutionary rate changes along the branches of phylogenetic trees, we show that the cerebellum underwent rapid size increase throughout the evolution of apes, including humans, expanding significantly faster than predicted by the change in neocortex size. As a result, humans and other apes deviated significantly from the general evolutionary trend for neocortex and cerebellum to change in tandem, having significantly larger cerebella relative to neocortex size than other anthropoid primates. These results suggest that cerebellar specialization was a far more important component of human brain evolution than hitherto recognized and that technical intelligence was likely to have been at least as important as social intelligence in human cognitive evolution. Given the role of the cerebellum in sensory-motor control and in learning complex action sequences, cerebellar specialization is likely to have underpinned the evolution of humans’ advanced technological capacities, which in turn may have been a preadaptation for language.},

Primates with large brains for their body size have relatively expanded visual brain areas, including the primary visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus. Within the visual system, it is, in particular, one functionally specialized pathway upon which selection has acted: evolutionary changes in the number of neurons in parvocellular, but not magnocellular, layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus are correlated with changes in both brain size and ecological variables (diet and social group size). Given the known functions of the parvocellular pathway, these results suggest that the relatively large brains of frugivorous species are products of selection on the ability to perceive and select fruits using specific visual cues such as colour. The separate correlation between group size and visual brain evolution, on the other hand, may indicate the visual basis of social information processing in the primate brain.},

The traditional Piagetian interpretation is that the error reflects the immaturity of infants' understanding of objects as permanent entities. More recently, the error has been interpreted in terms of changes in representation, in memory, in spatial knowledge, and in inhibitory processes. Each account may be partially right but none offers a unified account of the many accumulated facts about this error. This article presents and tests a new unified explanation. The authors propose that the perseverative reach back to A is the product of the processes that take a hand to a location in visual space: the body-centered nature of the spatial code, memories for previous reaching activity, and the close coupling of looking and reaching. The results from 6 experiments support this explanation. The results are used to challenge the idea of knowledge independent of and distinct from behavior.},

	abstract = {Animals commonly form groups and most sexually dimorphic ungulates form sex-specific groups outside the breeding season. Differences in diet, in vulnerability to predation, and in behaviour between the sexes are hypothesized to drive sexual segregation; however, low-density conditions sometimes favour aggregation. This may occur because larger groups provide greater antipredator benefits that overcome the cost of association between the sexes. In this study we sought to determine whether bighorn rams and ewes (Ovis canadensis) aggregate during winter as an antipredator strategy and whether they alter their behaviour to maintain mixed-sex groups. We compared the occurrence of mixed-sex groups during winter against the population size and sex ratio, and assessed vigilance as an indication of predation risk. We also analysed activity budgets to determine whether group cohesion required departure from sex-specific time budgets. We observed a low proportion of mixed-sex groups in all years of our study except one, in which the population size was very small and the proportion of females was the smallest on record. Mixed-sex groups were larger than single-sex groups, and vigilance was lower in larger groups, indicating that mixed-sex groups provided greater antipredator benefits. However, there was evidence of the oddity effect for older females, which displayed greater vigilance in groups composed primarily of males. Females modified their activity budgets in mixed-sex groups by spending less time foraging and travelling and more time bedding, providing support for the activity budget hypothesis. The costs of mixed-sex group formation limit the circumstances under which aggregation of the sexes is favourable.},

So it plays the task of reducing the number of independent microstates of a coherent system, becoming a candidate for implementing the concept of negentropy.

	abstract = {Many studies have evaluated why male mammals form social groups; few however have investigated how these groups are formed and maintained. We observed behavioral interactions of 15 male river otters (Lontra canadensis) captured in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, and held in captivity for 10�mo. Because the otters were captured in various areas and differed in age and relatedness, we were able to test how kinship and age influenced social interactions. We also explored how kinship, age and social interactions in captivity related to geographic spacing after the otters were released back in PWS. In 284�h of observations, the otters exhibited more positive than negative interactions. Social network models indicated that in the early stage of captivity, there were more links among individuals than in the late stage. In the late-stage period, older animals that had higher testosterone levels exhibited increased social distance and lower information centrality (a network connectivity metric). Social distance was not related to genetic distance, nor did it relate directly to age, although both social distance and age were correlated with post-release geographic distance. Thus, the formation of male groups in coastal river otters is largely influenced by familiarity and past experience, rather than kinship. The maintenance of groups, especially during the mating season, is a function of reproductive status and age, with older animals withdrawing from the social network during that time. What other phenotypic characters may contribute to the formation and maintenance of river otter groups merit future exploration.},

	abstract = {Birds are the only taxonomic group other than mammals that exhibit high-amplitude slow-waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.},

Few studies have investigated whether the context of a fight affects reconciliation—selective postconflict attraction between former opponents—and consolation: selective attraction between conflict participants and other group members. We studied social conflict and its aftermath in two captive groups of brown capuchins (Cebus apella), an arboreal New World species. We observed postconflict behavior in two contexts: (1) during the presence of highly attractive, clumped food—food condition—and (2) in the absence of such food—nonfood condition. Commercial monkey chow was available ad libitum in the nonfood condition. A comparison of postconflict and control observations revealed a conciliatory tendency in the capuchins, but only following fights that occurred in the absence of highly attractive food. Other group members tended not to seek postconflict contact with former conflict participants. However, when shortly after fights recipients of aggression, but not aggressors, initiated affiliation with third parties, the latter not only allowed proximity or contact but also often reciprocated through grooming, play, and especially the exchange of friendly signals. We discuss these results within the framework of current knowledge of postconflict behavior with special emphasis on similarities and differences in the postconflict behavior of Cebus and Pan.},

Sharing food includes different behaviours, notably offering food and co-feeding. In primates, food sharing between unrelated animals can largely be explained by reciprocity and harassment avoidance, while kin selection explains most instances of food sharing in cooperatively breeding birds. [`]Costly signalling' has also been put forward as an explanation of food sharing in birds. A recent study on jackdaws, Corvus monedula, suggested that the costly signal of food sharing, notably offering food between juvenile birds, may play an essential role in the formation of pair bonds. We analysed food-sharing patterns in a group of juvenile rooks, Corvus frugilegus and found differences between the two modes of food sharing: offering food and co-feeding. Food offering was affected by dominance relationships and by gender, whereas co-feeding was reciprocated and occurred mainly between nestmates. We conclude that offering food and tolerating co-feeding have different functions in rooks: food offering acts as a costly signal directed to all members of the group whereas patterns of tolerating co-feeding were in line with both the reciprocity and pair-bonding hypotheses.},

The third method, however, solves this potential shortcoming by identifying the [`]relevant' duration of the observations to be considered. We also emphasize the importance of distinguishing post-conflict affiliative interactions on the basis of their timing following a conflict in order to examine their conciliatory functions. Finally we suggest a correction of the conciliatory tendency, a measure used to compare the frequency of reconciliation between dyads of individuals that may have different baseline levels of affiliation. A comparison between the original measure and the corrected one shows that only the latter is independent of the baseline level of affiliation and is, therefore, more suitable for the study of intra- and inter-specific differences in the frequency of reconciliation.},

We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner of relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection. With IGEs, however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection, IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory of social evolution.},

Human emotional expressions, such as laughter, are argued to have their origins in ancestral nonhuman primate displays [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6]. To test this hypothesis, the current work examined the acoustics of tickle-induced vocalizations from infant and juvenile orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos, as well as tickle-induced laughter produced by human infants. Resulting acoustic data were then coded as character states and submitted to quantitative phylogenetic analysis. Acoustic outcomes revealed both important similarities and differences among the five species. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees reconstructed from the acoustic data matched the well-established trees based on comparative genetics. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that tickling-induced laughter is homologous in great apes and humans and support the more general postulation of phylogenetic continuity from nonhuman displays to human emotional expressions. Findings also show that distinctively human laughter characteristics such as predominantly regular, stable voicing and consistently egressive airflow are nonetheless traceable to characteristics of shared ancestors with great apes.},

When an individual stores food in a defended territory, the net benefit derived from hoarding depends on the cost of storing, the probability of recovering a stored item, its food value, and the multiplication rate of non-hoarded items. When hoarders live in a group, an additional cost may arise from ‘cheaters’, who do not store food themselves but parasitize the caches made by other individuals. Hoarding in this context can be adaptive if a hoarder is more likely than any other group member to recover its own items. This could come about either because individuals remember their own caching sites, or if individuals differ in their preferred foraging sites and cache food in their own kind of place. We also discuss conditions for the existence of a stable mixture of hoarders and cheaters in a group.},

We here tested this rarely examined hypothesis with juvenile and adult jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in three stimulus enhancement tasks, both in a non-food context (experiment 1) and in a food context (experiments 2 and 3). We first show that siblings and pair partners maintain stronger bonded social relations than do non-siblings and non-pair partners. We therefore tested individuals in sibling and non-sibling dyads and, later in ontogeny, in pair and non-pair dyads. Jackdaws either did not learn from any other conspecific (experiment 1), or they learned from non-affiliated individuals (non-siblings, non-pair partners in experiments 2 and 3). This may be related to two main characteristics of jackdaws' affiliated relationships. First, affiliates share food at a high rate and may rely on their knowledgeable partners to secure food rather than learning from them. Second, affiliates spend most time in close spatial proximity to each other which increases the probability that they simultaneously experience occurrences in their environment. Hence, spatially more distant individuals, which are more likely to be non-affiliated, face different foraging situations and may therefore provide more relevant information which may lead to selective social learning.},

There was no evidence for consolation—affiliative contact initiated by an uninvolved third party, directed towards victims of aggression—in either group when all affiliative behaviors were considered. However, embracing was a characteristic first-contact interaction between individuals involved in aggression and third parties. This finding mirrors the results concerning reconciliation in spectacled leaf monkeys. Accordingly, embracing may be a true consolatory behavior in this species. When contacts with third parties occurred before or in the absence of reconciliation, the timing of such contacts fell within the time window during which reconciliation normally occurs. These contacts also resulted in affiliation levels twice that of baseline levels, supporting the idea that these contacts may function as a form of substitute reconciliation.

	abstract = {In some cases male animals engage in aggressive contests for access to females, in others they adopt more passive strategies and invest in traits that assist them in detecting females or in competing with rivals in other ways, such as sperm competition. One possible factor determining the fitness of these different strategies is population density. Theoretically, aggressive tactics should be found at intermediate population densities. At low densities males that invest in traits related to searching for mates could be favoured, whereas at the highest densities males that fight over females might pay excessive costs for this behaviour because of the number of rival males that they will encounter. Current empirical evidence is mostly consistent with this scheme: in some cases it seems that traits that are associated with locating mates are favoured at low densities, with aggression related traits favoured at higher densities, and in other cases aggression is selected but as density increases less aggressive strategies become more common. There remain substantial differences between species, however, and I discuss how variation in mating system, in the costs of aggression and in the nature of sperm competition, plus ecological differences between species, can change the relationship between population density and the fitness consequences of aggressive and passive behavioural strategies.},

We analysed temporal stability and consistency of responses within and between situations involving exploratory and sociosexual behaviour. Exploratory behaviour was assessed both in the juvenile phase and in adulthood (2-3-year interval) by means of a novel object test and an open field test. We assessed agonistic behaviour twice in adulthood with a 7-month interval by confronting males with either a caged or a free-moving intruder. We assessed sexual behaviour in adulthood by presenting two caged conspecifics of the opposite sex. Exploratory scores still differed between the lines at both ages; however, slow birds became faster with age and were less stable than fast birds. Slow explorers spent more time in agonistic displays and took longer to attack than fast birds. Slow birds also took longer than fast birds to approach a member of the opposite sex. We conclude that, at the level of line, behavioural differences were stable over time and extended to other situations. At the individual level, consistency across time and situations was less evident overall, but fast birds tended to be more consistent than slow birds. Slow explorers could be described as reactive copers, showing a relatively high degree of behavioural plasticity, and fast explorers as proactive, in line with similar studies in rodents.},

We present data from long-term behavioural observations of eight pairs of fork-marked lemurs, including year-round data on their sleeping site use and spatial data from simultaneous focal follows of both pair partners, that characterize its social organization as [`]dispersed pairs'. Although pairs were stable over several years, territories of pair partners overlapped almost perfectly and interactions between them were frequent, the cohesiveness of pairs was extremely low. High rates of conflict relative to frequencies of affiliative interactions indicated that avoidance of the pair partner is the key mechanism responsible for the observed pattern of space use. The repeated use of the same predictable food resources during the night, frequent conflicts over food and patterns of vocal communication imply that avoidance of direct feeding competition, together with incomplete knowledge about the pair partner's position, lead to the observed low cohesiveness. The freedom to forage solitarily and the associated lack of information about the pair partner's position found in fork-marked lemurs are in contrast to most group-living species and qualify dispersed pairs as a focus for future studies of models on animal movement decisions.

In reality, however, such dependencies are likely to be widespread and often strong, generating complex behavioural dynamics. To model this process and illustrate potential consequences for the evolution of behavioural interactions, we consider the behavioural dynamics of the interaction between caring parents and their demanding offspring, a prime example of long series of interdependent and highly dynamic interactions. These dynamics can be modelled using functions describing mechanisms for how parents and their offspring respond to each other in the interaction. We establish the general conditions under which the behavioural dynamics converge towards a proximate equilibrium and refer to such converging interactions as behaviourally stable strategies (BSSs). We further demonstrate that there is scope for behavioural instability under realistic conditions; that is, whenever parents and/or offspring [`]overreact' beyond some threshold. By applying the derived condition for behavioural stability to evolutionary models of parent-offspring conflict resolution, we show by numerical simulations that evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) of current models are not necessarily behaviourally stable. Because behavioural instability implies that expressed levels of behaviours deviate from the ESS, behavioural stability is required for strict evolutionary stability in repeated behavioural interactions.},

	abstract = {aDepartment of Entomology, Texas A\&M University, College Station, TX 77843-2475, USA Insect societies are often described as superorganisms, and there are many functional parallels between organisms and superorganisms. Elegant work using ants shows that nutrient regulation, which occurs in many non-social animals, can also occur at the colony-level.  Key to the survival and growth of the superorganism, and also true for any non-social organism, is obtaining nutrients in the correct amounts and balance. Most animals require the same suite of about 30 nutrients — for example, a range of amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, vitamins, and in the case of insects, sterols — but the amounts and ratios that are needed to optimize growth differs among species, and can differ within a species depending on developmental or reproductive status [3]. In this issue of Current Biology, Dussutour and Simpson [4] report, for the first time, that a superorganism can simultaneously regulate the intake of multiple nutrients to optimize colony growth. Equally important, they show the amounts of nutrients consumed, and the ratios in which they are consumed, are determined by the composition of the colony. For any non-social organism feeding decisions with respect to specific nutrients are made based on that individual's current needs [5] and [6]. In contrast, a superorganism's feeding decisions are more complex because foraging is restricted to a subset of a colony's members. Thus, the challenge for individuals tasked with foraging is to address their own nutritional needs, while also responding to the needs of the queen, larvae, nurse ants and other workers. So what are the nutritional needs of the different members of an ant colony? Vinson and colleagues [7] and [8], studying red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), found that foragers, nurses and workers primarily require energy, while larvae and queens require significant quantities of protein for growth and egg production, respectively. Adult ants are poor digesters of protein, so nurse ants generally take protein to the larvae first, where it can be digested extra-orally. Nurse ants then collect the digested protein and feed it to the queen, but nurses may also retain some for themselves, as a reserve. All members of the colony also require oils, with queens requiring greater proportions than either workers or larvae. In a series of starvation experiments, Vinson and colleagues [9] also demonstrated that fire ant foragers respond appropriately to nutritional deficits. When the colony was starved for sugar, more sugar was returned, with foragers retaining most of it. When colonies were starved for oil, foragers brought more oil back. It was distributed across the colony, but more of it went to nurses. Finally, when colonies were starved for protein, foragers returned with more protein, with much of it being retained by nurses. But how did foragers know what to collect? Ants exchange food with one another via trophallaxis, and a typical chain of exchange between members of a colony is shown in Figure 1. Reserve workers collect food from foragers, and pass it on to nurses, which in turn share it with the larvae. Foragers and larvae are thus linked by reserve and nurse ants, and nurse ants are likely to play a critical role in terms of providing information to the foragers about the current nutritional needs of the larvae in the colony [10]. The acceptance or rejection of food returned to the colony by foragers should heavily influence a forager's decision to return with a similar food type. For instance, a steady supply of protein-rich insect material would be of little value to colonies with a small relative population of larvae. In the real world, though, organisms must simultaneously regulate multiple nutrients if they are to optimize performance. Protein and carbohydrates are the two key macronutrients that strongly influence ant colony growth and survival [11], and Dussutour and Simpson [4] used the experimental approach of the ‘Geometric Framework’ [12] and [13] to study protein and carbohydrate regulation in an evolutionarily primitive omnivorous and opportunistic ant (Rhytidoponera sp.) which includes in its diet arthropods, dead insects, seeds and honeydew from sap-feeding hemipterans [14]. The Geometric Framework was originally developed to explore nutrient regulation in solitary insect herbivores, namely locusts and caterpillars, but over recent years it has also successfully been applied to study nutrient regulation in other animals, including chickens [15], rats [16], mice [17], fish [18], and humans [19]. The strength of the Geometric Framework is two-fold. First, it identifies the extent to which an organism, or superorganism, regulates, or ‘defends’, a specific nutrient ‘intake target’. For example, Figure 2A shows two foods, each containing fixed ratios of protein and carbohydrate, represented as trajectories, or ‘rails’, extending outwards from the origin. An organism can reach its protein–carbohydrate intake target, defined as the blend of protein and carbohydrate that results in optimal growth, by switching back and forth between these two food rails. Dussutour and Simpson [4] found that their ants are strong protein–carbohydrate regulators across a range of nutritional scenarios, but that the protein:carbohydrate ratio a colony defends shifts depending on the presence of larvae. It is protein-biased when larvae are present, but carbohydrate-biased when larvae are absent. This shift could reflect changes in the nutritional needs of the colony, because larvae fail to grow when protein intake is low. Nurse ants were likely mediating this shift by rejecting offerings of protein-rich foods when larvae were absent. The second strength of the Geometric Framework is that it can reveal the extent to which an organism, or superorganism, prioritizes one nutrient over the other when confined to nutritionally imbalanced foods. In the case of protein–carbohydrate regulation, this response can be measured experimentally by placing an organism on a range of diets with various protein:carbohydrate ratios, measuring protein–carbohydrate intake for each diet, and then constructing an ‘intake array’ using the observed intake points for each diet. As shown in Figure 2B, a nearly vertical intake array demonstrates strong protein-regulation, while a horizontal intake array demonstrates strong carbohydrate-regulation. A third outcome, a more curved intake array, represents a compromise between over-eating the nutrient which is in excess of requirements, while under-eaten the nutrient that is in deficit. Dussutour and Simpson's [4] work shows that ants, in the absence of larvae, place a premium on carbohydrate regulation. In contrast, when larvae are present, colonies restricted to carbohydrate-rich foods abandon carbohydrate regulation in order to increase their intake of protein, which is essential for larval development. When ants are restricted to protein-rich diets, however, they fail to overcome the carbohydrate deficit. High worker mortality was observed on the protein-rich foods both in the presence and absence of larvae, despite the fact that ants were able to manipulate the collected diet. They were very efficient at extracting carbohydrate, and processing and rejecting large quantities of protein, but clearly there was a cost associated with performing this task, particularly in the absence of the larvae. Additionally, larval survival and development was also extremely poor on protein-rich diets. This finding is consistent with work showing that larval and colony growth is greatly enhanced when both protein and carbohydrates are in adequate supply [11] and [20]. Ants have clearly proven to be premier organisms for research in behavioral ecology and sociobiology, and have been used to greatly further our understanding of a number of biological phenomena [1]. Dussutour and Simpson's [4] paper helps shed further light on the nature of physiological and behavioral regulatory processes in social organizations, and the hierarchy in control processes, particularly in relation to nutrition. This paper also demonstrates that for organisms and superorganisms alike, optimal performance is all about getting their nutritional balance right.},

In this essay we show that especially corvids display behavioral skills within the domains of object permanence, episodic memory, theory of mind, and tool use/causal reasoning that are insightful. These similarities between humans and corvids at the behavioral level are probably the result of a convergent evolution. Similarly, the telencephalic structures involved in higher cognitive functions in both species show a high degree of similarity, although the forebrain of birds has no cortex-like lamination. The neural substrate for insight-related cognitive functions in mammals and birds is thus not necessarily based on a laminated cortical structure but can be generated by differently organized forebrains. Hence, neither is insight restricted to mammals, as predicted from a "scala naturae", nor is the laminated cortex a prerequisite for the highest cognitive functions.},

One of the most intriguing (but often neglected) ecological phenomena in African rain forests is the interaction between swarm-raiding army ants and ant-following birds. Similar to their well-known Neotropical representatives, ant-following birds in Africa track the massive swarm raids of army ants and feed on arthropods flushed by the ants. In this study we analyzed the effect of habitat fragmentation and degradation of a mid-altitude Congo-Guinean rain forest in western Kenya on the structure of ant-following bird flocks. Significant numbers of swarm raids were located in all forest fragments and in both undegraded and degraded forest. Fifty-six different species of birds followed army ant raids, forming bird flocks of one to 15 species. We quantitatively differentiated the bird community into five species of specialized ant-followers and 51 species of opportunistic ant-followers. Species richness and size of bird flocks decreased with decreasing size of forest fragments and was higher in undegraded than in degraded habitat. This was caused by the decrease of the species richness and number of specialized ant-followers at swarms, while the group of opportunistic ant-followers was affected little by habitat fragmentation and degradation. The composition of bird flocks was more variable in small fragments and degraded forest, compared to undegraded habitat in large fragments. The effect of habitat fragmentation on flock structure was best explained by the strong decline of the abundance of specialized ant-followers in small forest fragments. To conserve the association of army ants and ant-following birds in its natural state, vast areas of unfragmented and undegraded tropical rain forest are necessary.},

In the laboratory, some animals can learn the specific duration (seconds or minutes) between periods of food access [2].

We provided free-living, territorial rufous hummingbirds each with eight artificial flowers containing sucrose solution. Four flowers were refilled 10 min after the bird emptied them, and the other four were refilled 20 min after being emptied. Throughout the day, birds revisited the 10 min flowers significantly sooner than they revisited the 20 min flowers, and return visits to the flowers matched their refill schedules. Hummingbirds remembered the locations and timing of eight rewards, updating this information throughout the day. Not only is this the first time that this degree of timing ability has been shown in wild animals, but these hummingbirds also exhibit two of the fundamental aspects of episodic-like memory (where and when 4 and 5), the kind of memory for specific events often thought to be exclusive to humans 6 and 7. Author Keywords: SYSNEURO Many important events in animals' lives, from the availability of food to the arrival of predators, occur predictably in time, and many animals are able to gauge the intervals between these events [e.g., 2 and 8]. Timing abilities range in scale from animals varying activity levels according to events (such as the predictable onset of dawn and dusk) to anticipating the availability of food over shorter intervals. Other events, however, have a far less predictable periodicity and, in the case of nectarivores feeding on renewing food sources, the periodicity is, to a large extent, dependent on their own actions. Because emptied flowers might take several hours to replenish, hummingbirds could save time and energy by avoiding them. To do this, the bird should remember not only where the flower was, but also when it was last visited. Territorial rufous hummingbirds avoid recently emptied flowers by remembering where the flowers were 9 and 10, and traplining hummingbirds show some evidence of being able to track temporal changes 11 and 12. This experiment was designed to determine whether free-living rufous hummingbirds could remember when they had visited a number of artificial flowers (see Figure 1), which were then refilled at intervals of either 10 or 20 min after being emptied. After a number of days, we compared the timing of the birds' visits made to both 10 and 20 min flowers. Visits were defined as probes made by the bird to individual flowers within a foraging bout. The intervals between visits to each flower were calculated for each experimental session. Frequency distributions of all “postreinforcement pauses” (PRPs), the intervals between a bird's current visit to a flower and its last rewarded visit to that flower, were then constructed (Figure 2). Because interbout intervals were determined by the birds, and tended to be less than 10 min (Bird 1: 8 min; Bird 2: 10 min; Bird 3: 6 min), birds had frequent opportunities to visit all the flowers and yet decline visits to flowers that had been emptied during the recent foraging bouts. The patterns of visitation to the array support three primary inferences. The first is that birds learned that the refill rates differed among the flowers. Birds revisited the 10 min flowers significantly sooner than they visited 20 min flowers (Mann Whitney U tests, adjusted for ties: Bird 1, n = 2271; Bird 2, n = 2504; Bird 3, n = 3277; p {\textless} 0.0001 in all three cases). Critically, the PRPs for 10 min flowers were significantly shorter than the value 20 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: p {\textless} 0.001 in all three cases), indicating that the birds avoided the 20 min flowers when they returned to the array sooner than 20 min after the previous bout. Given that all of the flowers differed in their color and pattern and they were not arranged by refill rate, it seems that the birds do not use relative familiarity of the array to determine which flowers should be visited 13 and 14. The second inference that can be drawn from these data is that the hummingbirds learned that the specific refill times were 10 and 20 min. Whereas many studies indicate that animals anticipate rewards, and indeed many of the individual hummingbird PRPs were shorter than the refill rate, the birds' central tendency was to match or exceed the refill rate. Not one of the median values was shorter than the refill rate (Wilcoxon 1-tailed, 1-sample tests, 10 minutes: Bird 1, median = 14 min, n = 1231; Bird 2, median = 13 min, n = 1361; Bird 3, median = 12 min, n = 1933; for all, p {\textless} 0.001; 20 minutes: Bird 1, median = 20 min, n = 1050, p = 0.51; Bird 2, median = 21 min, n = 1143, p = 0.001; Bird 3, median = 20 min, n = 1344, p = 0.07). An alternative measure of central tendency is the mode. Modal PRPs matched refill rates very closely (10/20 min flowers: Bird 1: 11/21 min; Bird 2: 10/20 min; Bird 3: 10/20 min; Figure 2). Finally, the hummingbirds distinguished between 10 min and 20 min flowers, in general, and they also seem to have remembered specifically which flowers they had emptied recently. Such abilities have been shown only in laboratory experiments in which animals receive extensive training. Not only were the hummingbirds able to learn the refill schedules, as shown in other animals in the laboratory, but more remarkably, the hummingbirds were also able to update this information across numerous foraging bouts throughout the day. Such updating abilities have rarely been demonstrated in any animal. It is to be expected that animals increase their responding rate in concert with reinforcement rate when faced with concurrent choices offering different rates of reward (the matching law 15, 16 and 17). All birds visited 10 min flowers significantly more frequently than 20 min flowers (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: all p {\textless} 0.004). Ten minute flowers were not, however, visited twice as often as 20 min flowers (ratio of visits to 10:20 min flowers: Bird 1: 1.08, Bird 2: 1.20, Bird 3: 1.43; all tested against H0 = 1, all p {\textless} 0.004; tested against H0 = 2, all p {\textless} 0.001). Such a deviation from strict matching is, however, also common to other studies 18 and 19. Across days, birds varied in how well their visits matched the refill schedule. From the first session onward for all three birds, their visits to the 10 min flowers always matched, or exceeded, 10 min. In contrast, revisiting of the 20 min flowers took a little over two sessions before the PRPs were consistently around 20 min or longer (Figure 3). Given that they visited these flowers less frequently than the 10 min flowers, it is perhaps not surprising that it took the birds longer to learn the refill schedule. This is also consistent with the finding that longer intervals are harder to time than shorter ones (see e.g., [20]), as a result of increased uncertainty in estimating longer intervals [21]. However, this should also result in the standard deviation of timing an interval being proportional to the magnitude of that interval (see e.g., [16]), which was not the case for any of the birds: Although the coefficients of variation did not differ between the two refill rates (paired t test: t = 1.37, p = 0.31, df = 2), the standard deviations (SDs) for 10 min were significantly different from those for 20 min (mean SD10 = 8.14, mean SD20 = 11.18; t = 6.69, p = 0.02, df = 2). All the birds learned the two intervals more readily, if not quite as accurately, as animals trained in the lab, and the birds timed the 20 min refill flowers better than would have been expected. It must also be remembered that these birds were both “in control” of the experiment and constantly occupied with other important behaviors throughout the experiment, such as displaying to females and guarding their territory against intruding conspecific males. Their timing ability seems all the more impressive given these competing calls on their attention and time. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that free-living animals remember both the locations of multiple rewards and when they visited each of those locations. Additionally, in order to continue doing this accurately through the day and between days, the birds had to be able to update their memories continually for each flower. Because natural flowers differ in nectar level and concentration, and hummingbirds are able to remember each of these [22], they may well be able to remember all three components of a flower (where, when, and what). Territorial hummingbirds would, then, like food-storing birds, appear to make use of episodic-like memories in their everyday lives 23 and 24. Although there are both rat and primate episodic-like-memory models in which the animals remember the what and where of an item or event 25, 26, 27 and 28, it is the temporal component of a memory that has been difficult to demonstrate (25 and 29, but see [30]). Keeping track of the timing of past events is, however, a constant part of daily life for a foraging, territorial hummingbird. The timing abilities of these birds, thus, provide a useful contribution to the current debate on episodic-like-memory processes and whether or not they exist in animals other than humans. The subjects used in this experiment were three wild, male rufous hummingbirds. The experiment was run from 0800–2000 hr Mountain Standard Time in June and July 2000 in a valley in the eastern Rocky Mountains, Alberta, Canada. Rufous hummingbirds migrate to this valley to breed, and males set up territories centered around artificial feeders. It took 1–2 hr to train each bird to feed from artificial flowers, containing sucrose, placed in his territory. A flower consisted of a white cardboard disc (6 cm diameter), mounted horizontally on a wooden stake (60 cm high). At the center of the flower was a blue syringe tip (capable of holding 120 μl) in a small cork mounted on top of the stake. When the bird was consistently feeding from these flowers, the experiment began. At the start of a day's testing, the bird's feeder was removed and an array of eight flowers was placed in his territory, in the same place for each session. The array consisted of eight flowers in a 3,2,3 configuration with a nearest-neighbor distance of 60 cm. The flowers were the same as in training except that each was of a different color (neon green, orange, blue, brown, purple, yellow, green, red). Each flower contained 20 μl (concentration 20\%) sucrose solution. Once the bird had visited the array for the first time, two different fixed-interval flower refill schedules were used. Four flowers were designated as 10 min flowers, i.e., each was refilled 10 min after the bird had emptied that flower, the other four as 20 min flowers, i.e., refilled 20 min after being emptied. The locations of 10 and 20 min flowers within the array were determined in a pseudorandom fashion and remained the same throughout the experiment. The male was free to visit flowers throughout the day. At the end of each session, the array was removed and the bird's feeder replaced. Small markers were placed in the ground to ensure that in subsequent sessions the array was put back in the same place. The time of the bird's visits to the array and the flowers visited in each bout were recorded throughout each session. The total number of bouts varied across birds (Bird 1, 536 bouts across 13 sessions; Bird 2, 495 bouts across 11 sessions; and Bird 3, 695 bouts across 12 sessions). To ensure that the results we observed above were not an artifact of the birds' repeatedly using the same visiting strategy, one that happened to interact with our experimental refill rate, which could then lead to a bias in the temporal distribution of the data, we also repeated all of the analyses by using only the data from the first visit birds made to a flower following their last rewarded visit (the first PRP). However, although there were many fewer data, of the outcomes reported above, the only difference seen between the two data measures is that the birds returned to the 20 min flowers sooner than 20 min. Nonetheless, they still returned to 10 min flowers significantly sooner than to the 20 min flowers.

Developmental experience plays a role, along with heritable variation, in calibrating the response dynamics of this system. This calibration occurs through setting of response thresholds in the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate the expression and use of trait-specific gene products and environmental elements that build alternative phenotypes. Whereas natural selection tends to favor developmental plasticity when the fitness of alternative phenotypes can be predicted from observable cues, genetic polymorphisms are most likely to be maintained when the advantages of niche specialization are high and organisms can evaluate and select their niches. Well-developed theories of both adaptive phenotypic plasticity and adaptive genetic variation in the stress-response systems have been advanced in the literature. Taken together, these theories strongly suggest that variation in stress-response phenotypes has been shaped by natural selection, is an adaptation to multiniche environments, and involves an integration of genetic influences and condition-sensitivity.},

The study also examined the relation of these variables to reactive and proactive aggression, to entitlement to resources (related to the threatened egotism theory of aggression) and mate value (central to a modular theory of self-esteem and more broadly to sexual selection). The findings showed only a weak association between size and strength and direct aggression, which was also significantly correlated with entitlement and mate value, as predicted. Mate value also showed some association with size and strength. Reactive but not proactive aggression was linked with entitlement, but neither was associated with size or strength. In a regression analysis, controlling for age, mate value was the strongest predictor of direct aggression, but both weight (highly correlated with strength) and entitlement were marginally significant predictors independent of mate value. The findings provide support for the view that young males who view themselves as more attractive to women are more aggressive, independently of the impact on aggressiveness of RHP or entitlement to resources.},

The purpose of this paper is to introduce the practice theory approach in relation to studies of everyday life, domestic practices and consumption, and to argue that this approach can be fruitful for ecological economics and other fields interested in the environmental aspects of consumption.

The brain-cooling hypothesis further stipulates that, as ambient temperature increases and approaches (but does not exceed) body temperature, yawning should increase as a consequence. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 20 budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, through the manipulation of room temperature. Birds were exposed to three separate conditions (control temperature (22 °C), increasing temperature (22-34 °C), and high temperature (34-38 °C)) in a repeated measures design, with each condition lasting 21 min. The incidence of yawning differed significantly across conditions (4.20 ± 2.39 yawns per bird in the increasing temperature condition, compared to 2.05 ± 1.90 and 1.25 ± 0.72 yawns per bird, in the high temperature and control conditions, respectively).

Chimpanzees were considered to fit well into this scheme with highly social and competing philopatric males and generally asocial and solitary dispersing females. However, recent data suggest that chimpanzee females can indeed be highly social, even though they are unlikely to be related to each other. We studied female sociality in a long-term habituated group living in the Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire. Female social relationships as measured by association and grooming preferences were well differentiated and long lasting. Association (and to a lesser extent grooming) bonds were associated with reduced aggression between social partners. In addition, the competitive regime as indicated by group size had a strong effect on female social networks, which were more centralized and less clustered in smaller groups, suggesting that competition may play a major role in shaping female chimpanzee sociality.

Involuntary subordination is a construct derived from social rank theory and has been implicated as a cause of major depression. Its most salient features include feelings of entrapment and unfavourable social comparisons (i.e., low perceived status). An initial sample of 146 graduate students underwent a diagnostic interview to confirm a history of major depression and also completed measures of entrapment and social comparison. After 16 months, participants were assessed for a recurrence of major depression. Participants who experienced a recurrence of depression had significantly higher levels of involuntary subordination (as measured by factor scores of entrapment and social comparison). A logistic regression analysis also showed that involuntary subordination predicted recurrence of depression, even when controlling for current major depression and the number of previous episodes. The present study demonstrates the advantages of adopting a social rank perspective in modeling major depression. La présente étude a eu recours à une conception prospective afin d'évaluer le rôle de la subordination involontaire en tant que prédicteur de la dépression majeure. La subordination involontaire est un construit issu de la théorie du rang social et a été associée comme une des causes de la dépression majeure. Ses caractéristiques dominantes sont notamment le sentiment d'être prisonnier et les comparaisons sociales défavorables (c.-à-d. perception négative de soi). Un échantillon de 146 étudiants des cycles supérieurs s'est soumis à une interview diagnostique afin de confirmer des antécédents de dépression majeure; ils ont en outre rempli des mesures du sentiment d'être prisonnier et des comparaisons sociales. Seize mois après l'entrevue, les participants ont été évalués afin de déterminer la récurrence de la dépression majeure. Les participants qui ont vu la dépression réapparaître présentaient des niveaux élevés de subordination involontaire (mesurés par les scores factoriels du sentiment d'être prisonnier et des comparaisons sociales). L'analyse de régression logistique a également indiqué que la subordination involontaire est un facteur qui permet de prédire la récurrence de la dépression, même lorsque l'on tient compte de la dépression majeure actuelle et du nombre d'épisodes antérieurs. La présente étude met en évidence les avantages apportés par l'adoption de la théorie du rang social pour la modélisation de la dépression majeure.

Despite a long history of scientific investigation, only now are we beginning to decipher the relationship between individuals and group-level properties. This interdisciplinary effort is beginning to reveal the underlying principles of collective decision-making in animal groups, demonstrating how social interactions, individual state, environmental modification and processes of informational amplification and decay can all play a part in tuning adaptive response. It is proposed that important commonalities exist with the understanding of neuronal processes and that much could be learned by considering collective animal behavior in the framework of cognitive science.},

Coalition formation is a complex behavior, typically described in highly social and cognitively complex species. Surprisingly, we know little about the social and environmental factors that may select for the evolution of coalitions. We studied the evolution of coalitionary behavior by first redefining it in a continuous way that acknowledges variation in the degree to which animals collaboratively work toward a common goal. We then examined the evolutionary association of coalition complexity with 3 social factors (estrous duration, group size, and presence of a dominance hierarchy) and 3 environmental factors (habitat type, diurnality, and diet type). We found that estrous duration, group size, and dominance hierarchy were significantly correlated with coalition complexity and thus conclude that social factors are relatively more important in the evolution of complex coalitions than are environmental factors. From these results, we infer that complex coalitions may be the product of social factors that reduce female monopolizability and encourage the aggregation of multiple males.},

	abstract = {Conflicts over food, access to mates, or other limited resources can sometimes escalate into aggression. In species that form social groups, these aggressive conflicts can jeopardize the benefits of group living, such as enhanced access to valued resources, necessitating the development of behavioural mechanisms that either mitigate conflicts, prevent aggressive escalation or resolve disputes. Two important mechanisms for managing the effects of disputes involve postconflict (PC) affiliative behaviour, either between the former opponents (called 'reconciliation') or between one opponent and a third party. Even though numerous studies have tested reconciliatory and third-party affiliation tendencies in primates, for non-primate animals little systematic data are available. We performed behavioural observations on three groups of captive domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and used a PC/MC method to test the existence of reconciliation and third-party affiliation in this species. The results of this study clearly indicate that both reconciliation and third-party PC interactions are present in the domestic dog, and form important social mechanisms of the domestic dog. Furthermore, familiar individuals showed a significantly higher proportion of reconciled conflicts than did unfamiliar individuals, and also displayed fewer conflicts. Finally, we show that most of the third-party affiliations involve the victim of a conflict and that victim-directed affiliation outweighs victim-initiated third-party affiliation in these PC interactions.},

The bees could perform well in the learning tests and various transfer tests, in which (i) all contextual cues from the learning test were present; (ii) the colour cues of the visual patterns were removed, but the location cue, the orientation of the visual patterns and the temporal cue still existed; (iii) the location cue was removed, but other contextual cues, i.e. the colour and orientation of the visual patterns and the temporal cue still existed; (iv) the location cue and the orientation cue of the visual patterns were removed, but the colour cue and temporal cue still existed; (v) the location cue, and the colour cue of the visual patterns were removed, but the orientation cue and the temporal cue still existed. The results reveal that the honeybee can recall the memory of the correct visual patterns by using spatial and/or temporal information. The relative importance of different contextual cues is compared and discussed. The bees' ability to integrate elements of circadian time, place and visual stimuli is akin to episodic-like memory; we have therefore named this kind of memory circadian timed episodic-like memory.},

	abstract = {Neuronal mechanisms of episodic memory, the conscious recollection of autobiographical events, are largely unknown because electrophysiological studies in humans are conducted only in exceptional circumstances. Unit recording studies in animals are thus crucial for understanding the neurophysiological substrate that enables people to remember their individual past. Two features of episodic memory�-�autonoetic consciousness, the self-aware ability to ldquotravel through timerdquo, and one-trial learning, the acquisition of information in one occurrence of the event�-�raise important questions about the validity of animal models and the ability of unit recording studies to capture essential aspects of memory for episodes. We argue that autonoetic experience is a feature of human consciousness rather than an obligatory aspect of memory for episodes, and that episodic memory is reconstructive and thus its key features can be modeled in animal behavioral tasks that do not involve either autonoetic consciousness or one-trial learning. We propose that the most powerful strategy for investigating neurophysiological mechanisms of episodic memory entails recording unit activity in brain areas homologous to those required for episodic memory in humans (e.g., hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) as animals perform tasks with explicitly defined episodic-like aspects. Within this framework, empirical data suggest that the basic structure of episodic memory is a temporally extended representation that distinguishes the beginning from the end of an event. Future research is needed to fully understand how neural encodings of context, sequences of items/events, and goals are integrated within mnemonic representations of autobiographical events. � 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

One emphasizes that the judgment of the duration of a stimulus depends on the operation of dedicated neural mechanisms specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events. Alternatively, the representation of duration could be ubiquitous, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of nondedicated neural mechanisms. In such models, duration might be encoded directly through the amount of activation of sensory processes or as spatial patterns of activity in a network of neurons. Although intrinsic models are neurally plausible, we highlight several issues that must be addressed before we dispense with models of duration perception that are based on dedicated processes.},

Bi-directional (or simultaneous mutual) grooming is unusually common among chimpanzees (though rare in other primates) and we suggest that this might be because it is an especially strong indicator of social bonding. Because the bonding role of bi-directional grooming offers substantially different predictions from the interpretation offered by the models based on reciprocal altruism (RA), we use a critical tests methodology (i.e. tests that unequivocally support one hypothesis at the expense of the other) to differentiate between the bonding and RA hypotheses. We use data on the dynamics of grooming interactions from a captive group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to show that dominant individuals tolerated the individuals with whom they performed bi-directional grooming more than they did those who typically provided them unidirectional grooming. Dominants rejected and terminated grooming sessions more often with the individuals who provided them with mostly unidirectional grooming than with those with whom they groomed bi-directionally. In addition, animals engaged in bi-directional grooming more often with both relatives and those with whom they were often in proximity. These results support the bonding model of mutually reciprocated grooming at the expense of the RA model, and suggest that, at least in chimpanzees, simultaneous mutual grooming may play a particularly important role in social bonding.},

The species is a semi-colonial, socially monogamous passerine which establishes long-term pair bonds. Parents raise a single annual brood in which 50\% brood reduction is commonplace. However, nest sites are a limited resource, non-breeding adults are also common around colonies and males are frequently separated from their incubating females during the fertile egg-laying period so that opportunities arise for extra-pair copulation. The parentage analysis, however, revealed no cases of extra-pair fertilisation (EPF) or intra-specific brood parasitism. Therefore fledgling output or survival is likely to be a good measure of individual reproductive success in this species. The lack of EPFs is not explained by nesting synchrony and we discuss the relative costs and benefits to females of seeking EPFs; the likelihood that paternal care and a life-history strategy similar to many long-lived non-passerines may also constrain the species to monogamy.},

The temporal control of searching at recovery was also observed when the familiarity of cache sites did not provide any information about the time of caching and when the same food was cached in distinct sites at different times.

Reconciliation reduces stress-related behavior of the aggressee. We investigated the influence of various affiliative postconflict behaviors of the aggressor on the aggressor's scratching rates in captive long-tailed macaques: reconciliation, contacts with the aggressee's kin (or substitute reconciliation), and contact with other group members (or triadic affiliation). After a conflict, the aggressor showed an increase in rates of scratching. Scratching rates were reduced after reconciled conflicts compared to nonreconciled conflicts. Substitute reconciliation did not reduce scratching when we controlled for the influence of reconciliation, i.e., the aggressor might not interpret it as a substitute for reconciliation. Triadic affiliation did not reduce scratching rates, hence, triadic affiliation probably does not console the aggressor. Scratching rates after reconciliation are significantly lower than scratching rates after triadic affiliation. This proves that the stress-reducing effect of reconciliation is not due to the calming effect of general body contact but that the stress reduction is specifically associated with contacts with the former opponent. The contestants are anxious about their relationship, and only reconciliation takes away this anxiety. Reconciliation is thus an important social repair strategy.},

We confirmed the occurrence of PPIAB (mean Triadic Contact Tendency: 41.7\%�16.2\% SEM) at frequencies comparable to PPIVB. Immature gorillas were responsible for most PPIAB. PPIAB occurred when the bystander was unrelated to either the aggressor or the victim, and when it was a relative of the aggressor. However, affinitive contact rates were higher in the former case. Unlike PPIVB, PPIAB significantly reduced the likelihood of further aggressions within the group, suggesting that they work at an immediate level.

Here we discuss the mechanisms generating such speed-accuracy tradeoffs, their implications for animal decision making (including signalling, communication and mate choice) and the significance of differences in decision strategies among species, populations and individuals. The ecological relevance of such tradeoffs can be better understood by considering the neuronal mechanisms underlying decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Both in captivity and the wild, primates are found to travel mostly to the nearest available resource, but they may skip over
the closest resource and travel to more distant resources, which are often found to be more productive. This study examines
the tradeoff between distance and reward in the foraging choices of one group of wild capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus) using feeding platforms in large-scale foraging experiments conducted over four years. Three feeding sites were arrayed
in an oblique triangle, such that once the monkey group had chosen one site to feed, they had a choice between two remaining
sites, a close one with less food and the other up to 2.3 times as far away but with more food. Sites were provisioned once
per day. The capuchins generally chose the closer feeding site, even when the more distant site offered up to 12 times as
much food. The distances to, rewards of, or various profitability measures applied to each alternative site individually did
not explain the group’s choices in ways consistent with foraging theory or principles of operant psychology. The group’s site
choices were predicted only by comparing efficiency measures of entire foraging pathways: (1) direct travel to the more rewarding
distant site, versus (2) the longer ‘detour’ through the closer site on the way to the more distant one. The group chose the
detour more often when the reward was larger and the added detour distance shorter. They appeared to be more sensitive to
the absolute increase in detour distance than to the relative increase compared to the straight route. The qualitative and
quantitative results agree with a simple rule: do not use the detour unless the energy gain from extra food outweighs the
energy cost of extra travel. These results suggest that members of this group integrate information on spatial location, reward,
and perhaps potential food competition in their choice of multi-site foraging routes, with important implications for social
foraging.},

	abstract = {Jackdaws are highly social corvids. They feed in flocks, roost communally and often breed in colonies, using natural holes as nest-sites. This study describes and investigates the social organisation of jackdaws. Particular attention is payed to the functional aspects of their social organisation. The study was carried out from 1971 to 1976 in and around the village of Haren in the north of the Netherlands. Most of the jackdaws nest singly in chimneys which are scattered over the area. A small colony was created by hanging nestboxes (15-25) on the walls of the Zoological Laboratory in Haren. It was here that most of the data were obtained. Over 600 birds were colour-banded for individual recognition. Within the population two social categories can be distinguished: resident and non-resident birds. The former defend one or more nest-sites throughout the year (except in summer). The latter defend one nest-site, only during the breeding season, if they are successful in obtaining one at all. Only adult and mated birds belong to the resident category whereas non-residents are of all ages, mated and non-mated. These categories are not static. Non-residents become residents and vice versa. Furthermore, the distinction between residents and non-residents appears to be more conspicuous in colonially nesting birds than in solitary nesting ones. In the study area 80\% of the adult colour-banded birds, present in any one year, was resighted the following year. Only 48\% of the first year birds was resighted again in the study area. Reproduction was approximately 1 young per pair per year. These figures show that the population is able to sustain itself. Estimations from other methods all suggest a much higher mortality rate. Some of these require an unrealistically high reproduction to prevent the population from declining to extinction. Some factors which may bias mortality estimations are discussed. Jackdaws are monogamous and mates remain together, both throughout the year and from year to year. Adult jackdaws are very unlikely to remate unless their mate dies. In contrast, newly mated, juvenile birds, readily change mates. However, the probability of divorce is not increased by an unsuccessful breeding attempt. Males and females react differently after losing their mate. Males try to retain their nest-site. As a result of the aggression by mated pairs, single males are seldom successful in maintaining nest-site ownership for long, but while they do, they appear to be very attractive to non-mated females. Females desert their nest-site and start to court mated (or non-mated) males possessing a nest-site. Non-mated females can gain much by seducing mated males but they seldom succeed. Jackdaws produce only one clutch per year. Resident pairs are more successful in breeding than non-resident pairs. This difference is affected by various factors, including nest-site quality, age, time of egg-laying and intraspecific interference in breeding. Pairs which failed to raise young often start to inspect other nest-sites thus harassing more successful pairs. Among the resident members of the colony a well developed, site independent rank-order was found. Males dominate females. The rank of the female depends on the presence and rank of her mate. Different dominance criteria produce different rank-orders. By allowing the birds to choose who to compete with over food, the connections between rank relationships and social preferences have been analysed. The jackdaws prefer to feed where a subordinate bird is present, avoid feeding with a dominant and seek interactions with individuals with whom the outcome of the interaction is rather unpredictable. Shifts in rank are most common during the breeding season. Unsuccessful breeders often rise in rank at the expense of successful ones. Feeding flocks are open groups with individuals and parties joining or leaving. However, resident members of a colony often feed together and form a rather stable core of many flocks, particularly in the vicinity of their colony. Flock sizes and feeding ranges vary seasonally. During the breeding season both are much smaller than during summer and winter. High ranking colony member have somewhat smaller feeding ranges than low ranking ones throughout the year, suggesting that the latter are forced to feed at larger distances. This is, however, still poorly understood. By feeding in flocks the jackdaws are able to withstand the attacks by territorial carrion crows. There are indications that the presence of crows and the vigour of their territorial defence, contribute to the flocking tendency in jackdaws. Flock feeding also increases the feeding efficiency of individual flock members by intraspecific social learning of new food sources. Birds which are familiar to one another are more likely to copy each other than are unfamiliar birds. The difference appears to be largely due to the fact that the jackdaws readily supplant a familiar bird engaged in exploiting a new food source, provided it is inferior in rank. By supplanting the birds apparently bring themselves into the right situation to copy the behaviour of another individual. The daily activities of resident pairs are centered around their nest-sites during most of the year. They defend one or more nest-sites and visit several others daily from early fall on. Both by defending more nest-sites and by visiting others, the jackdaws remain informed of alternatives should their own nest-site become unavailable or unsuitable for breeding. High rank, the number of defended nest-sites and priority of access to nest-sites in short supply, are correlated. Hole nesting not only protects the nest's contents against most predation, it also renders it possible for jackdaws to nest inside the territories of the interspecifically aggressive carrion crow. Colonial nesting appears to give no additional protection against nest predation under most conditions. Moreover, communal defence against nest predators is practically absent and so far there are no indications that jackdaws prefer to nest colonially. Field studies of social systems have produced a growing awareness of the fact that characters of behaviour, morphology, demography and social structure are not independent but form an adaptive complex. Some of the relationships between these characters in the jackdaw are discussed. Finally, environmental factor, such as predation, the availability of food and interspecific competition, mould each of these characters and their relationships. In jackdaws the chief benefit of flock feeding and hole nesting seems to be that thus the jackdaws are able to withstand the interspecific aggression of the territorial carrion crow.},

This may cause social stress, modulating heart rate (HR), which may serve as a measure of energetic investment and also of individual emotional involvement. We investigated HR responses to social encounters in 24 free-living greylag geese in an intact social environment. We recorded 1602 social interactions of various intensities in which the focal individual either attacked another member of the flock or was attacked itself. We analysed five HR parameters (mean HR, maximum HR, HR increase, duration until maximum, time until the baseline value was reached again). Generally, HR scaled positively with increasing intensity of agonistic interactions as well as with increasing duration. Individuals showed higher HRs when attacking than when being attacked. In addition, focal individuals responded with a greater HR increase when confronted with an opponent winning a higher percentage of interactions than itself. Repeated agonistic interactions against a specific opponent were related to greater HR responses than single events and focal individuals responded more strongly to male opponents than to females. Our results indicate a differential HR response depending on the intensity and duration of an interaction as well as the identity of the opponent. This differential physiological investment may reflect differences in emotional involvement depending on the social context of a particular agonistic interaction.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Evidence suggests that humans might have neurological specializations for music processing, but a compelling adaptationist
account of music and dance is lacking. The sexual selection hypothesis cannot easily account for the widespread performance
of music and dance in groups (especially synchronized performances), and the social bonding hypothesis has severe theoretical
difficulties. Humans are unique among the primates in their ability to form cooperative alliances between groups in the absence
of consanguineal ties. We propose that this unique form of social organization is predicated on music and dance. Music and
dance may have evolved as a coalition signaling system that could, among other things, credibly communicate coalition quality,
thus permitting meaningful cooperative relationships between groups. This capability may have evolved from coordinated territorial
defense signals that are common in many social species, including chimpanzees. We present a study in which manipulation of
music synchrony significantly altered subjects’ perceptions of music quality, and in which subjects’ perceptions of music
quality were correlated with their perceptions of coalition quality, supporting our hypothesis. Our hypothesis also has implications
for the evolution of psychological mechanisms underlying cultural production in other domains such as food preparation, clothing
and body decoration, storytelling and ritual, and tools and other artifacts.},

The problem is corroborated because current multiperson PDs model simultaneous player action, known as a common goods situation, whereas multiperson collaboration could be easier to obtain in a PD with alternate player action, a private goods situation. Here we present such a game, called a dependency game, and show that stable collaboration can be obtained in a 255-player simulation if only players are allowed to remember three previous benefactors, so they can play advanced tit-for-tat. Furthermore, we show that such a freely collaborating population is threathened by assorted strategies, which define groups that parasitize on independent tit-for-tat players. By excluding others, these groups engage in indirect reciprocal behaviour. Our model therefore combines many hitherto separate collaboration-enhancing concepts into one game, and suggests that group formation and collaboration are two separate social phenomena.},

There were both solicited and nonsolicited contacts; the latter finding is in contrast with the result obtained in wild mountain gorillas, in which consolation was absent. Immature females were more likely to offer consolation toward both related and unrelated individuals. Consolation did not reduce the likelihood of further attacks among group members. It may be that, as the α-male plays a fundamental role in preventing the spread of conflicts throughout the entire group, triadic contacts become ineffective for the function. The levels of consolation were higher in absence of reconciliation than in its presence, suggesting that consolation may function as an alternative mechanism in stress reduction of the victim.},

	abstract = {Biologists have repeatedly rediscovered classical models from physics predicting collision rates in an ideal gas. These models, and their two-dimensional analogues, have been used to predict rates and durations of encounters among animals or social groups that move randomly and independently, given population density, velocity, and distance at which an encounter occurs. They have helped to separate cases of mixed-species association based on behavioural attraction from those that simply reflect high population densities, and to detect cases of attraction or avoidance among conspecifics. They have been used to estimate the impact of population density, speeds of movement and size on rates of encounter between members of the opposite sex, between gametes, between predators and prey, and between observers and the individuals that they are counting. One limitation of published models has been that they predict rates of encounter, but give no means of determining whether observations differ significantly from predictions. Another uncertainty is the robustness of the predictions when animal movements deviate from the model's assumptions in specific, biologically relevant ways. Here, we review applications of the ideal gas model, derive extensions of the model to cover some more realistic movement patterns, correct several errors that have arisen in the literature, and show how to generate confidence limits for expected rates of encounter among independently moving individuals. We illustrate these results using data from mangabey monkeys originally used along with the ideal gas model to argue that groups avoid each other. Although agent-based simulations provide a more flexible alternative approach, the ideal gas model remains both a valuable null model and a useful, less onerous, approximation to biological reality.},

Reconciliation reduces stress-related behavior of the aggressee. We investigated the influence of various affiliative postconflict behaviors of the aggressor on the aggressor's scratching rates in captive long-tailed macaques: reconciliation, contacts with the aggressee's kin (or substitute reconciliation), and contact with other group members (or triadic affiliation). After a conflict, the aggressor showed an increase in rates of scratching. Scratching rates were reduced after reconciled conflicts compared to nonreconciled conflicts. Substitute reconciliation did not reduce scratching when we controlled for the influence of reconciliation, i.e., the aggressor might not interpret it as a substitute for reconciliation. Triadic affiliation did not reduce scratching rates, hence, triadic affiliation probably does not console the aggressor. Scratching rates after reconciliation are significantly lower than scratching rates after triadic affiliation. This proves that the stress-reducing effect of reconciliation is not due to the calming effect of general body contact but that the stress reduction is specifically associated with contacts with the former opponent. The contestants are anxious about their relationship, and only reconciliation takes away this anxiety. Reconciliation is thus an important social repair strategy.},

In species that form social groups, these aggressive conflicts can jeopardize the benefits of group living, such as enhanced access to valued resources, necessitating the development of behavioural mechanisms that either mitigate conflicts, prevent aggressive escalation or resolve disputes. Two important mechanisms for managing the effects of disputes involve postconflict (PC) affiliative behaviour, either between the former opponents (called 'reconciliation') or between one opponent and a third party. Even though numerous studies have tested reconciliatory and third-party affiliation tendencies in primates, for non-primate animals little systematic data are available. We performed behavioural observations on three groups of captive domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and used a PC/MC method to test the existence of reconciliation and third-party affiliation in this species. The results of this study clearly indicate that both reconciliation and third-party PC interactions are present in the domestic dog, and form important social mechanisms of the domestic dog. Furthermore, familiar individuals showed a significantly higher proportion of reconciled conflicts than did unfamiliar individuals, and also displayed fewer conflicts. Finally, we show that most of the third-party affiliations involve the victim of a conflict and that victim-directed affiliation outweighs victim-initiated third-party affiliation in these PC interactions.},

value of charity is not limited to those who receive the services that giving makes possible. On the contrary, charity unleashes
substantial benefits to the givers themselves.},

	abstract = {Observations on the breeding behaviour of Rooks were made between 1943 and 1955. The gonads of a series of Rooks from the same area and during the same period were examined (Marshall \& Coombs 1957). The autumn sexual resurgence is comparable to early spring in both gonad condition and behaviour.  Display postures are described. A slow wing-raising component, common to several postures, is very rare and perhaps absent when the testes are refractory. It might have a sexual significance.  Rooks use song posts, but song is not used in the establishment or defence of territory.  Copulation occurs most frequently between birds that are not paired to each other. It is usually interfered with, and in more than 90\% of the incidents observed the female was incubating. Resemblances between the incubating position and the female soliciting posture may lead to this.  The territory is a small area round each nest: neighbouring territories may overlap. Rooks who are active in pilfering a neighbour's nest for building material, may establish some territorial dominance over it.  Nest sites are selected by both sexes and in both spring and autumn. Either sex can build a nest. Normally the male does most of the stick structure, and the female more of the cup and lining.  During incubation the female is fed on the nest by the male, and after the young have hatched for as long as he can provide food for her as well as the young. Droppings are removed by both parents, partly as a response to fouling of the nest.  Development of the gonads and of the behaviour of juveniles is described. A few birds reach breeding condition at one year old, the majority a year later. Expectation of life at one year old is probably four years.  Some data are given on the relationship with other Corvidae in the area and with some other species.},

Vocal dialects have provided a useful model for the study of cultural evolution and its interactions with genetic evolution. This study examined the acoustic and geographical changes in vocal dialects over an 11-year span in the yellow-naped amazon, Amazona auropalliata, in Costa Rica. Contact calls were recorded at 16 communal night roosts in 1994 and 19 roosts in 2005, with 12 of the roosts sampled in both surveys. In both surveys, three dialects were found, each characterized by a distinctive contact call type and each encompassing multiple roosts. The limits between two of these dialects, the North and South dialects, was found to be geographically stable, while at the boundary between the North and Nicaraguan dialect there was introgression of each call type into roosts in the bordering dialect. Acoustic measurements and cross-correlations of spectrograms detected no change in the acoustic structure of contact calls in the South dialect but did show significant differences in the calls of both the North and Nicaraguan dialect between 1994 and 2005. These results are consistent with the vocal convergence hypothesis, which proposes that dialects are long-term features maintained through some combination of biased transmission of local call types and purifying selection against foreign call types. Migration, copying errors and cultural drift may also play a role in the more subtle changes seen in the acoustic form of dialect call types.

It is particularly a problem in species such as humans, where there is cooperation between nonrelatives. Numerous possible solutions have been suggested for the problem of cooperation between nonrelatives, including punishment, policing, and various forms of reciprocity 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. Here, we suggest that local competition for resources can pose a problem for these hypotheses, analogous to how it can select against cooperation between relatives 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. We extend the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game to show that local competition between interacting individuals can reduce selection for cooperation between nonrelatives. This is because, with local competition, fitness is relative to social partners, and cooperation benefits social partners. We then test whether nonrelated humans adjust their level of cooperation facultatively in response to the scale of competition when playing the PD for cash prizes. As predicted, we found that individuals were less likely to cooperate when competition was relatively local. Cooperation between humans will therefore be most likely when repeated interactions take place on a local scale between small numbers of people, and competition for resources takes place on a more global scale among large numbers of people. Author Keywords:EVO\_ECOL In the PD game, two individuals interact with each other and choose whether to cooperate or not cooperate (defect or cheat) [22]. The payoffs assumed for different strategies lead to the focal player doing better if they defect, irrespective of whether the other player cooperates or defects, but both parties defecting gives a lower payoff than if both had cooperated (Table 1). The dilemma is that from a selfish perspective each will decide that the best course is defect, thus making both worse off than if they had both cooperated. The most famous solution to this problem occurs when players interact a number of times (multiple rounds), termed the iterated PD [22]. In this case, cooperation can be favored by a “Tit-For-Tat” (TFT) strategy, which is to cooperate in the first round and in every subsequent round copy the partner's play from the previous round [22]. TFT is a strategy of facultative (reciprocal) cooperation, which punishes defectors by not cooperating with them. We introduced the possibility of local competition for resources into the PD (Supplemental Data available with this article online). Specifically, we introduced a scale of competition parameter, a, that denotes the proportion of competition that occurs locally (i.e., at the level of the pair of social partners engaged in an evolutionary game) as opposed to globally (i.e., at the level of the whole population). Our results showed that as competition became more local, cooperation was selected against (Figure 1). Specifically, the expected number of interactions between players (rounds per game), required for TFT to be stable against invasion by always defect, increased with more local competition (higher a). Higher numbers of interactions favor altruism because they allow greater opportunities for reciprocal altruism 4 and 22. As competition becomes more local, the payoff of the focal individual relative to their partner becomes more important. With global competition (a = 0), fitness is determined by the classical payoff structure (absolute values). However, as competition becomes more local, the relative payoff becomes more important, and the absolute payoff becomes less important. In the extreme, with completely local competition (a = 1), the focal individual is competing only with their partner, and so fitness is determined by how the focal individual does relative to their partner. Cooperation never results in an increase in relative payoff, whereas defection does (Table 1). Consequently, the dilemma disappears, as defection always leads to a higher payoff, and both players cooperating does not lead to a higher payoff than both players defecting (Table 1). We then tested our model by examining whether nonrelated humans adjust their level of cooperation in response to the scale of competition. We made students play the PD game in groups of three. Each student played each of the other two students for an unknown number of repeated interactions (an average of seven rounds). We varied the scale of competition by having five groups play at a time (a class) and giving cash rewards to the top five scores in the class for relatively global competition or the top score in each group for relatively local competition. Each student played once with relatively local competition and once with relatively global competition. We found that students showed higher levels of cooperation when competition was relatively global than when competition was relatively local (Figure 2). This result held irrespective of whether analysis was carried out at the level of the individual (t = 7.34, n = 57, p {\textless} 0.0001; 52/57 individuals showed higher levels of cooperation with relatively global competition), group (t = 7.80, n = 9, p {\textless} 0.0001; 9/9 groups), or class (t = 10.97, n = 4, p = 0.002; 4/4 classes). Overall, students were more than twice as likely to cooperate with relatively global competition (44\% of the time) than they were with relatively local competition (18\%; Figure 2). We have shown that local competition for resources between nonrelatives selects against cooperation (Figure 1). As competition becomes more local, the fitness of an individual becomes more dependent upon how they do relative to the partners that they interact and potentially cooperate with. In this case, cooperation is selected against because it never leads to an increase in payoff relative to the beneficiary of cooperation (Table 1). Another way of conceptualizing this is that local competition leads to the increased fitness of the beneficiary of altruism coming at the cost of the provider of the cooperation and so selects against cooperation. We used the framework provided by the PD, because it is a commonly used tool for demonstrating the problem of cooperation between nonrelatives 4 and 22, and because we were able to test these predictions experimentally with humans. Several authors have argued that the PD, and the ability of reciprocal altruism to solve the problem of cooperation, require a large number of very specific assumptions and are likely to be of limited importance outside of humans 8 and 23. However, reciprocal altruism is just one of many mechanisms that can provide a direct fitness benefit to cooperation—alternatives include group augmentation, policing, sanctions, and punishment 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 24. We suggest that the consequences of local competition for these different mechanisms will depend upon how cooperation is favored. Although local competition makes relative fitness more important and, hence, selects against cooperation, it can also increase the advantage of punishing or spiteful behaviors 25 and 26, which can be used to enforce cooperation. Our results also illustrate a problem that needs to be solved in the theoretical literature. Several simulation studies, based on the PD, have suggested that limited dispersal favors cooperation 27 and 28. In contrast, analytical studies have suggested this will not necessarily be true because limited dispersal can also increase local competition. In the simplest case, the effect of increased competition exactly negates any benefit of limited dispersal 17 and 29. More complex analytical models can be constructed in which limited dispersal does not lead to such an increase in local competition, and hence, cooperation can be favored, depending upon biological details 3, 16, 17, 18, 19, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35. This raises the question of what assumptions have removed this problem in the simulation studies and allowed the benefits of limited dispersal to outweigh the cost of increased competition. Our results showed that humans were more likely to cooperate in the PD when competition was more global. This will happen when individuals tend to have repeated interactions (with the potential for cooperation) with a small number of other individuals (or within groups), but competition for resources occurs with a larger number of people (or between groups). Humans are a useful study organism for testing this hypothesis, as their cognitive abilities could allow the scale of competition to be assessed. In addition, determining the cognitive tools involved in cooperation between humans is key to resolving the debate over how the data from experimental games are to be interpreted 36, 37, 38 and 39. We suspect that with most other organisms individuals will not be able to assess variation in the scale of competition, and so the response will be evolutionary rather than behavioral (i.e., fixed not facultative) 20 and 21. An implication of our results is that if the perceived scale of competition is manipulated, then this will alter the level of cooperation among humans. This could occur in numerous ways in all forms of society. One way is to create a common enemy, who must be competed against relatively globally. A famous example of this is in Nineteen Eighty-Four, where The Party uses a poster with a “monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier” to unite the proles into “one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism” [40]. As Hamilton 15 and 41 pointed out, the same competitive issues that can favor cooperation within groups, can also favor the evolution of hostility (or war) between groups. An alternative possibility is to reward local cooperation. For example companies (or any form of institution) could provide productivity rewards (or evaluations) to individuals that depend in part upon the performance of the workers that interact with that individual, rather than just the performance of the individual or the company as a whole. We carried out the following experiment on four undergraduate classes, three containing 15 students and one containing 12 students. Two of these classes were in 2004 and two were in 2005. This class was prior to a course on social evolution theory, which means it was before the students were taught relevant evolutionary biology. Each class was split up into five groups of three students (four groups in the class with 12 students). The PD was then explained to the students, who were then allowed to play approximately seven interactions to familiarize themselves with it. We then made the students play for cash rewards. Cash rewards were given out anonymously. In two classes, the students played the relatively local competition session first and then the relatively global competition session second. In the other two classes, the students played the relatively global competition session first. For each class, we did the following. Within each group of three students, each student played each other for one game. Each game was for an average of seven repeated interactions of the PD, with the number of interactions unknown to the students (who were only told that there was an equal likelihood of the game finishing after each interaction). For each interaction, both players made their decisions simultaneously, without knowledge of the other's decision. After each interaction, the students were told the strategy that they had each chosen, and the points pay off, before the next interaction. We varied the scale of competition by how cash prizes were awarded. The details of the cash rewards were given to the students at the start of each session (global or local). For relatively global competition, the five students in the class who scored the most points won £10 (top four students in the class with 12 students). For relatively local competition, the top score in each of the five (or four) groups of three students won £10. This procedure meant that the total amount awarded was the same for both local and global competition. An equally valid way of conceptualizing this is by considering within and between group competition: within group competition is relatively greater with local competition. Our aim with this experiment was to test whether individuals adjusted their level of cooperation in response to the scale of competition. We tested for this by comparing the average proportion of interactions in which they cooperated, when playing the same two players, with relatively local and global competition. Data were arcsin square root transformed prior to analysis to remove the problem of nonnormal errors that can arise with proportion data. It can be argued that the results from the three individuals in the same group are not independent, because they arise from the same games. Consequently, we examined the robustness of results by analyzing our data at a number of levels: individuals (n = 57), groups (n = 9), and classes (n = 4). We calculated the proportion of times the individual (or group or class) cooperated (arcsin square root transformed) with relatively global competition minus the proportion of times the individual (or group or class) cooperated with relatively local competition. These values were then tested against the null hypothesis that the average value did not differ significantly from zero (i.e., there was no difference in the likelihood of cooperation between relatively local and relatively global competition) with a t test. All analyses were carried out with the package GLMStat 6.0 (http://www.glmstat.com). By comparing the incidence of cooperation in the relatively local and global games, we provide a qualitative test of our theory. Cooperation in humans has been much investigated, and the importance of a range of other factors has been demonstrated, including sanctions, image scoring, and indirect reciprocity 4, 5, 6, 7, 36, 39, 41, 42, 43 and 44. In our experiment, the students were split by boards when playing the game and were not allowed to talk or signal at any point. Despite this, we cannot eliminate the possibility that their behavior was influenced by prior knowledge of each other, such as image scoring. However, this would only influence the average level of cooperation between players, at both local and global competition, and so does not alter our ability to test for differences between these two experimental treatments. A possible influence of time or experience (number of games played) was controlled for by making the students play local first in two classes and global first in two classes. Our results therefore show that when all else is equal, variation in the scale of competition leads to different levels of cooperation, suggesting that the importance of these other factors will be mediated by the scale of competition.

	abstract = {The ability to recognize and accurately interpret facial expressions is critically important for nonhuman primates that rely on these nonverbal signals for social communication. Despite this, little is known about how nonhuman primates, particularly monkeys, discriminate between facial expressions. In the present study, seven rhesus monkeys were required to discriminate four categories of conspecific facial expressions using a matching-to-sample task. In experiment 1, the matching pair showed identical photographs of facial expressions, paired with every other expression type as the nonmatch. The identity of the nonmatching stimulus monkey differed from the one in the sample. Subjects performed above chance on session 1, with no difference in performance across the four expression types. In experiment 2, the identity of all three monkeys differed in each trial, and a neutral portrait was also included as the nonmatching stimulus. Monkeys discriminated expressions across individual identity when the nonmatch was a neutral stimulus, but they had difficulty when the nonmatch was another expression type. We analysed the degree to which specific feature redundancy could account for these error patterns using a multidimensional scaling analysis which plotted the perceived dissimilarity between expression dyads along a two-dimensional axis. One axis appeared to represent mouth shape, stretched open versus funnelled, while the other appeared to represent a combination of lip retraction and mouth opening. These features alone, however, could not account for overall performance and suggest that monkeys do not rely solely on distinctive features to discriminate among different expressions.},

Despite a consensus about the benefit of reconciliation, how former opponents achieve this benefit remains unclear. Variation within reconciliation is evident in many species, but understanding what causes the variation has been mostly neglected until now. We collected 178 events of reconciliation of both sexes in a community of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Ta� National Park, C�te d'Ivoire. Our data provide evidence for the relationship-repair function of reconciliation, as aggression disturbed tolerance levels among former opponents and reconciliation restored tolerance to normal levels again. Partners with highly beneficial relationships reconciled more often compared with partners of low mutual benefit. Latency and duration of reconciliation varied in combination, such that short reconciliations were initiated soon after the conflict, while long reconciliations were initiated later. Latency increased with the risk of further aggression, while duration decreased when costs were incurred from interruption of beneficial activities. In contrast, the complexity of reconciliation varied according to the intensity of the preceding conflict, such that reconciliation was more complex after more intense conflicts. Our results suggest that relationships between opponents are increasingly disturbed with increasing conflict intensity and reconciliation repairs all relationships independent of their relationship value. We propose that the function of reconciliation is to reduce the disturbance created by aggression, but the more frequent the reconciliation, the more beneficial it is for former opponents.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that it should often be in the best interests of gregarious animals to repair social bonds damaged by within-group conflict. Indeed, reconciliation in many primates takes the form of affiliative behavior occurring shortly after a conflict. Here we inquired whether reconciliation also occurs among spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), gregarious carnivores whose social lives share much in common with those of cercopithecine primates. In a large group of free-living hyenas in Kenya, we used focal animal observations to monitor rates at which various affiliative behaviors occurred before and after dyadic aggressive interactions. An affiliative behavior was identified as having a conciliatory function only if it occurred more frequently after than before fights, and if it was also associated with reduced rates of aggression between former opponents during the post-conflict interval. Of all affiliative behaviors monitored, only two types satisfied both these criteria: greeting behavior and non-aggressive approach. Over 72\% of conciliatory behaviors occurred within the first five minutes after a fight, and hyenas reconciled after 14.6\% of 698 fights. Mean conciliatory tendency (CT) for individual hyenas was 11.3\%. Hyenas exhibited higher CTs when they were recipients (victims) of aggression than when they were aggressors, and they showed higher CTs in interactions with non-kin than with kin. Conciliatory tendencies did not vary with age2013sex classes of opponents or with rank distance between opponents. Conciliatory tendency in spotted hyenas fell at the low end of the CT range observed among primates.},

	abstract = {Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless.},

However, more recently, it has become clear that tradeoffs exist between decision speed and accuracy in many ecologically relevant tasks, for example, prey and predator detection and identification; pollinators choosing between flower species; and spatial exploration strategies. Obtaining high-quality information often increases sampling time, especially under noisy conditions. Here we discuss the mechanisms generating such speed-accuracy tradeoffs, their implications for animal decision making (including signalling, communication and mate choice) and the significance of differences in decision strategies among species, populations and individuals. The ecological relevance of such tradeoffs can be better understood by considering the neuronal mechanisms underlying decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {Throwing is a major behavioral component of hominid evolution. Comparison of this behavior across a broad range of non-human primate species is needed to elucidate the phylogenetic constraints on throwing behavior. In this study of stone-throwing in Japanese macaques, we present a systematic multi-group comparison of the frequency and prevalence of this behavior as well as detailed descriptions and quantitative data on the form, context, and possible social transmission of stone-throwing. Stone-throws were mainly underarm, performed from a tripedal posture, and often accompanied by repeated vertical leaps. We found marked individual hand preferences for throwing, but no consistent group-level handedness. Our results support the hypotheses relating body posture, throwing style, and handedness in throwing by primates. Based on the analysis of the contexts that may elicit the behavior, we postulate that unaimed stone-throwing in Japanese macaques may serve to augment the effect of agonistic displays, and accordingly, can be regarded as spontaneous tool-use. Our findings are consistent with the comparative data using modern non-human primate species to model the structural processes and functional aspects of throwing evolution in early hominids. This study supports the view that tool-use evolves from initially non-functional behaviors, such as stone handling, which is a form of object play. Stone-throwing by Japanese macaques meets several criteria of a behavioral tradition, including group-specificity. This first report of a stone-tool-use tradition in Japanese macaques is of direct relevance to the question of the evolution of stone technology in hominids.

	abstract = {Animal personalities, defined as consistent and correlated individual differences in behavioral traits, are suggested to be common in the animal kingdom and can have important fitness consequences. Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species. Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings, behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic plasticity in wild populations.},

Since primates are highly social animals and their sociality is considered a strong selective force that resulted in complex cognitive capacities, planning is also expected in social situations. Unfortunately, prompting from social partners cannot be excluded in a social setting. Therefore, we controlled for this factor by testing the capacity to plan in chimpanzees using an exchange paradigm, that involves both a material and a social component, and a tool-use paradigm, similar to the one used on two other ape species. All chimpanzees failed to plan in the exchange task, but three individuals showed planning behavior in the tool-use task. Our methods controlled for the fact that chimpanzees were not prompted by the visibility of the reward at the moment of planning and also could not repeat a previously acquired routine. The best interpretation for our results is that chimpanzees can plan. However, planning was limited to the situation where the action to attain the future benefit only depended on a chimpanzee's own behavior.},

Experiments on food-caching memory in scrub jays question this assumption. On the basis of a single caching episode, scrub jays can remember when and where they cached a variety of foods that differ in the rate at which they degrade, in a way that is inexplicable by relative familiarity. They can update their memory of the contents of a cache depending on whether or not they have emptied the cache site, and can also remember where another bird has hidden caches, suggesting that they encode rich representations of the caching event. They make temporal generalizations about when perishable items should degrade and also remember the relative time since caching when the same food is cached in distinct sites at different times. These results show that jays form integrated memories for the location, content and time of caching. This memory capability fulfils Tulving's behavioural criteria for episodic memory and is thus termed 'episodic-like'. We suggest that several features of episodic memory may not be unique to humans.},

	abstract = {Ho do parents resolve their conflict over parental care? The classical "sealed-bid" model of biparental care suggested that parents use a fixed best effort given the partner's effort. Alternatively, parents may "negotiate" their actual effort until the efforts of both partners settle down to limiting values, but in this case, the resulting efforts will not be the best responses to one another. Consequently, under the best response scenario, the response of 1 parent to the removal of its mate can be predicted from the response to a reduction in its partner's effort, whereas the "negotiation" model predicts that such an extrapolation will underestimate the effort of a parent caring alone. We tested this prediction in free-living house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We experimentally manipulated the males' parental care as follows: males' care in group 1) was reduced by using a capture-handling-release stress protocol, 2) stopped by removing the male, and 3) left as control. In response to these manipulations, control females kept their feeding rate constant, whereas male-stressed-released females showed a moderate increase of feeding rate. When this response was extrapolated to zero male effort, their effort was still significantly lower than the observed effort of male-removed females. These results suggest that females may use the negotiation rule to determine their actual parental effort.},

It is known that agonistic behavior and social ranking often interact with hormones such as testosterone (T) and glucocorticoids (GCs). The challenge hypothesis states that T levels in males are promoted by the agonistic behaviors of other males and has been widely testified in many taxa of vertebrates, even in humans, but seldom attempted in rodents. Here, we examined how fecal T and corticosterone (CORT) concentrations changed during prolonged social conflict in male greater long-tailed hamsters (Tscheskia triton). Dyads were subjected to 5 min staged encounters daily for 15 days during which agonistic and social behaviors were recorded and fecal hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Our results showed that pairwise male hamsters developed overt and stable dominant-subordinate relationships rapidly and that the agonistic behavior decreased over the course of the experiment. Dominant males exhibited more frequent flank marking and locomotion and shorter latency to initial attack than their subordinate counterparts. Testosterone levels were significantly increased in both dominant and subordinate males during early encounters, but T and CORT levels were higher in subordinate males. After five encounters, we found no difference between hormone levels and behavior for all males, implying some kind of behavioral and physiological habituation. This complex pattern of hormonal change during social conflict is discussed and correlations between behavioral and physiological habituation are hypothesized.},

Enrichment programs have been shown to prevent or reduce the development of behavioral vices, stereotypy, and fearfulness. However, the protocols used in enrichment studies can be inconsistent: under some protocols, enrichments are provided but not changed, while under others, enrichments are rotated frequently. Enrichment experiments to date have also largely ignored the influence of individual differences on fearfulness. The aim of this study was to determine whether frequent rotation of enrichment objects ("high novelty") was more effective than simply providing enrichment objects ("low novelty") in reducing neophobia in juvenile orange-winged Amazon parrots and to determine whether individual differences significantly affected neophobia. Thirty-four juvenile orange-winged Amazon parrots received both an 11-week high-novelty (HN) treatment and an 11-week low-novelty (LN) treatment, which were given in random order. Neophobia was assessed by measuring birds' latency to feed from a dish of highly favored food in the presence of various novel objects at approximately 10-day intervals. Our results indicate that the HN treatment significantly reduced neophobia in juvenile orange-winged Amazons. We also found that both individual variation in fearfulness and the novel object used for testing significantly affected birds' latency to feed in the presence of novel objects. Our results indicate that rotation of enrichment objects is more effective than simply providing enrichments in reducing fearful behavior in parrots. The effect of rotating enrichments was strong enough to overcome approximately four-fold differences in birds' latency to feed in the presence of different novel objects and even greater individual differences in neophobia. However, we also found that in highly fearful individuals, HN actually increased birds' latency to feed in the presence of novel objects. Our results indicate that rotation of enrichment objects is more effective than simply providing enrichments in reducing fearful behavior in parrots, but that both enrichment object properties and individual differences should be carefully considered in the design of future enrichment studies and protocols.},

The function of this reconciliation behavior is thought to be the repair of the social relationship between the two opponents. We examined the hypothesis that reconciliation is socially effective because it may also lead to a reduction of the victim's acute stress. Reconciliation was studied in a well-established captive group of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). The behavior of the victim in a 10 min period after the end of an agonistic interaction was recorded and compared with that of a control observation made on the same animal the next day. The tendency to reconcile was elevated above control levels only during the first 3 min. Reconciliation led to a fast reduction in scratching rates and to a decrease of the reoccurrence of aggression received. Losers took the initiative to reconcile more than expected. Dominants granted reconciliation depending on their relatedness with the victims and on the quality of the relationship with them. After those interactions in which contra-aggression and no clear submission occurred, the reconciliation rate was remarkably high. These results suggest that reconciliation can be an effective means to reduce the victim's acute stress and that its function in repairing social relationships can partly be mediated by its physiological effects. The intimate relation between the quality of the social relationship and the conciliatory tendency can be extrapolated to explain interspecific variation.},

During the last two decades research on gregarious animals, especially primates, has focused on the mechanisms of conflict management, mainly on friendly postconflict reunions (also called [`]reconciliation') in which former opponents exchange affiliative behaviour soon after an aggressive conflict. Our aim in this paper is to present a framework in which the costs and benefits of friendly postconflict reunions, both for each individual opponent and for their mutual relationship, are used to predict the patterning of postconflict resolution mechanisms in other gregarious animals. The framework predicts the occurrence of postconflict reunions in species that live in stable social units, have individualized relationships, and experience postconflict hostility, but especially in those in which intragroup aggression disrupts valuable relationships. The critical issue is whether aggressive conflicts occur between cooperative partners and whether the level of aggression is sufficient to jeopardize the benefits associated with such valuable relationships. We conclude by proposing four research priorities to evaluate the role of friendly reunions in negotiating relationships and the way they are themselves influenced by asymmetries in partner value and biological market effects.

	abstract = {Previously, a hormone-simulated pregnancy (HSP), and the subsequent [`]postpartum' withdrawal in estradiol has been shown to precipitate depressive-like behaviours in the forced swim test in female rats. In this study, we used the HSP and [`]postpartum' withdrawal to investigate the impact on sucrose consumption, a model of anhedonia. Rats were assigned to "postpartum", "postpartum" + EB (estradiol benzoate), "postpartum" + IMI (imipramine; a tricyclic antidepressant), "postpartum" + DPN (diarylpropionitrile; an ER[beta] agonist), or ovariectomized (OVX) controls and OVX + IMI treatments. All "postpartum" groups received daily hormone injections (estradiol and progesterone) over 23 days to simulate pregnancy, while IMI groups also received daily injections of imipramine. After Day 23, "postpartum" rats were withdrawn from the hormone regimen (mimicking the postpartum decrease in gonadal hormones), and then received daily injections of compounds indicated (DPN, EB, IMI). Rats were tested for consumption of, and preference for, sucrose weekly at baseline, during [`]pregnancy' and on [`]Postpartum' Days 2-3. During the [`]postpartum' period rats in the "postpartum" group had lower sucrose consumption and preference compared to during late-[`]pregnancy', but no decrease in [`]postpartum' consumption or preference was seen in any other groups except "postpartum" + IMI and a decrease in sucrose preference only in the postpartum + EB group from mid-[`]pregnancy' to [`]postpartum'. The OVX  + IMI group had decreased sucrose consumption relative to OVX controls, suggesting a negative effect of imipramine on sucrose consumption. Together, these results suggest an important, though complex, role for gonadal hormones in the behavioral changes accompanying this model of depression.},

Much recent evidence has implicated the social domain as a major challenge driving increases in problem-solving abilities of mammals. However,�the methods of measurement available to researchers are often indirect and sometimes appear to give conflicting answers, and other intellectual challenges may also have been influential in cognitive evolution. While the cause of an evolutionary increase in intelligence may be domain-specific (sociality, for example), and the brain specialization that results may largely implicate a single perceptual system, such as vision, the intelligence shown in consequence can be very [`]general-purpose' (as in primates and some avian taxa). Future research needs to get beyond vague ascription of [`]greater intelligence' or [`]faster learning' towards a precise account of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie particular mental skills in different species; that will allow theory-testing against data from complex, natural situations as well as from the laboratory, on a common metric.},

	abstract = {The field of behavioral neuroendocrinology has generated thousands of studies that indicate differences in brain structure and reactivity to gonadal steroids that produce sex-specific patterns of social behavior. However, rapidly emerging evidence shows that genetic polymorphisms and resulting differences in the expression of neuroactive peptides and receptors as well as early-life experience and epigenetic changes are important modifiers of social behavior. Furthermore, due to its inherent complexity, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying sex differences in social behavior are usually studied in a tightly regulated laboratory setting rather than in complex environments. Importantly, specific hormones may elicit a range of different behaviors depending on the cues present in these environments. For example, individuals exposed to a psychosocial stressor may respond differently to the effects of a gonadal steroid than those not exposed to chronic stress. The objective of this review is not to re-examine the activational effects of hormones on sex differences in social behavior but rather to consider how genetic and environmental factors modify the effects of hormones on behavior. We will focus on estrogen and its receptors but consideration is also given to the role of androgens. Furthermore, we have limited our discussions to the importance of oxytocin and vasopressin as targets of gonadal steroids and how these effects are modified by genetic and experiential situations. Taken together, the data clearly underscore the need to expand research initiatives to consider gene-environment interactions for better understanding of the neurobiology of sex differences in social behavior.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to studying social relationships in captive adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) was taken by using principal components analysis (PCA) to extract three key components of relationship quality from nine behavioural variables. Based on the loadings of the behavioural variables, the components appeared to match previously hypothesized critical aspects of social relationships and were therefore labelled Value, Compatibility and Security. The effects of kinship, sex combination, age difference and time spent together on each of the relationship quality components were analysed. As expected, kin were found to have more valuable, compatible and secure relationships than non-kin. Female2013female dyads were found to be more compatible than male2013male or mixed-sex dyads, whereas the latter were found to be most secure. Partners of a similar age were found to have more secure and more valuable relationships than those with a larger age gap. Individuals that were together in the group for longer were more valuable and more compatible, but their relationships were found to be less secure than individuals that were together in the group for a shorter time. Although some of the results may be unexpected based on chimpanzee socio-ecology, they fit well overall with the history and social dynamics of the study group. The methods used confer a significant advantage in producing quantitative composite measures of each component of relationship quality, obtained in an objective manner. These findings therefore promote the use of such measures in future studies requiring an assessment of the qualities of dyadic social relationships.},

	abstract = {The conscious recollection of unique personal experiences in terms of their details (what), their locale (where) and temporal occurrence (when) is known as episodic memory and is thought to require a [`]self-concept', autonoetic awareness/conciousness, and the ability to subjectively sense time. It has long been held that episodic memory is unique to humans, because it was accepted that animals lack a [`]self-concept', [`]autonoetic awareness', and the ability to [`]subjectively sense time'. These assumptions are now being questioned by behavioral evidence showing that various animal species indeed show behavioral manifestations of different features of episodic memory such as, e.g. [`]metacognition', [`]conscious recollection' of past events, [`]temporal order memory', [`]mental time travel' and have the capacity to remember personal experiences in terms of what happened, where and when. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview on the current progress in attempts to model different prerequisites and features of human episodic memory in animals and to identify possible neural substrates of animal episodic memory. The literature covered includes behavioral and physiological studies performed with different animal species, such as non-human primates, rodents, dolphins and birds. The search for episodic memory in animals has forced researchers to define objective behavioral criteria by which different features of episodic memory can be operationalized experimentally and assessed in both animals and humans. This is especially important because the current definition of episodic memory in terms of mentalistic constructs such as [`]self', [`]autonoetic awareness/consciousness', and [`]subjectively sensed time', not only hinders animal research on the neurobiology of episodic memory but also research with healthy human subjects as well as neuropsychiatric patients with impaired language or in children with less-developed verbal abilities.},

	abstract = {Women are more sensitive to most noxious visceral stimuli, both in terms of intensity and frequency. The spinoparabrachial (spino-PBn) pathway is an essential neural circuit for the central relay of viscerosensitive information, but studies characterizing the anatomical and physiological characteristics of this pathway have only been conducted in males. Sex differences in the anatomical and/or physiological organization of the spino-PBn may contribute to the sexually dimorphic incidence rate for visceral pain syndromes. Retrograde labeling and colorectal distention (CRD) induced Fos expression was used to delineate the spino-PBn circuit in male and cycling female Sprague-Dawley rats. The ability of morphine to suppress CRD evoked responses was also examined. Neurons retrogradely labeled from the PBn were localized primarily within the superficial dorsal horn and sacral parasympathetic nucleus of the L5-S1 spinal cord. While no sex differences were noted in either the distribution of spino-PBn neurons or in CRD-induced Fos expression, significantly greater Fos expression was noted specifically in spino-PBn neurons in males compared to females. Morphine selectively attenuated Fos expression in spino-PBn neurons in males, but not females. Subsequent anatomical studies showed significantly reduced mu opioid receptor protein levels and radioligand binding within the PBn of females in comparison to males. Together, these data indicate that there are profound sex differences in how a noxious visceral stimulus and opiates engage the spino-PBn pathway, which may account for the observed clinical differences in visceral pain sensitivity and morphine antinociception.},

During 2004-2007, we examined parentage as a function of relatedness and social interactions among members of 21 American crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos, family groups. Paired female breeders monopolized maternity of all offspring in their broods, whereas paired male breeders sired 82.7\% of offspring, within-group auxiliary males sired 6.9\% of offspring and extragroup males sired 10.4\% of offspring. Although adult females had fewer opportunities for direct reproduction as auxiliaries than males, they appeared to have earlier opportunities for independent breeding. These different opportunities for direct reproduction probably contributed to the male-biased adult auxiliary sex ratio. Patterns of reproductive partitioning and conflict among males were most consistent with a synthetic reproductive skew model, in which auxiliaries struggled with breeders for a limited reproductive share, beyond which breeders could evict them. Counter to a frequent assumption of reproductive skew models, female breeders appeared to influence paternity, although their interests might have agreed with the interests of their paired males. Unusual among cooperative breeders, close inbreeding and incest occurred in this population. Incest avoidance between potential breeders did not significantly affect reproductive skew.},

	abstract = {Calls and displays elicited by predators usually function as alarms or to inform predators of their detection. However, predator encounters may afford some individuals the opportunity to demonstrate quality or signal their availability. Here, I report on a class of vocal signals produced in predator-elicited displays that share many characteristics with sexually selected song. White-throated magpie-jays (Calocitta formosa) display at low-threat predators while producing 'loud display calls' (LDCs). I use this term because the calls occur primarily in two display contexts (see below) though occasionally in other contexts as well. Such calls and displays are primarily produced by males, and also occur in one other context, at dawn. Playback experiments showed that despite being elicited by predators, males were more likely than females to respond to LDCs, and more likely to respond when their mate was fertile. Over 134 different call types were produced in over 200 displays by 34 males; the largest minimum repertoire size was 67. Presentations of taxidermic raptor mounts elicited some LDCs, but fewer calls and lower diversity than at dawn or in predator approach displays. The male bias and high diversity suggest that LDCs are an outcome of intersexual selection, while their elicitation by predators suggests an alarm function. I propose that male magpie-jays use predator encounters as opportunities to advertise their presence and availability as mates; they use LDCs as songs. Such a communication system seems to have been favored by the unusual social system of magpie-jays, in which female groups defend territories and males have little opportunity to defend resources for mate attraction, forcing them to advertise when females are paying the most attention, during predator encounters.},

We investigated whether domestic goats can use the gaze direction of a conspecific as a cue to find food. They were able to do this, at a level comparable to that of primates. In a second experiment, we tested goats' ability to use gaze and other communicative cues given by a human in a so-called object choice situation. An experimenter hid food out of sight of the subject under one of two cups. After baiting the cup the experimenter indicated the location of the food to the subject by using different cues. The goats used communicative cues (touching and pointing) but not gaze by itself. Since domestic dogs are very skilled in this task, whereas wolves are not, one hypothesis is that the use of communicative cues in the object choice task is a side-effect of domestication.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of communication depends on the detection of species-specific signals in background noise that includes other species' signals. To avoid confusion with each others' signals, species should partition communication space. I investigated this possibility for the dawn chorus of birds in an Amazonian rain forest. Acoustic censuses at a location in Matto Grosso, Brazil, detected 82 sedentary species of birds that sang frequently during dawn choruses. Eleven features of these species' songs were analyzed to characterize the acoustic space of this community. The Euclidean distances between species' songs in this acoustic space were then used to investigate spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic influences on the divergence of songs. Songs of species in the same stratum of the forest and during the same 30-min interval had the most dispersed songs. Songs of congeners and family members were more dispersed than songs of random species. These results indicate that in this complex acoustic environment, species singing at the same place and time partition signal space. These species either choose times and places for singing to minimize acoustic interference from other species or they have evolved different songs to reduce this interference.},

	abstract = {Humans and other animals do not use social learning indiscriminately, rather, natural selection has favoured the evolution of social learning rules that make selective use of social learning to acquire relevant information in a changing environment. We present a gene-culture coevolutionary analysis of a small selection of such rules (unbiased social learning, payoff-biased social learning and frequency-dependent biased social learning, including conformism and anti-conformism) in a population of asocial learners where the environment is subject to a constant probability of change to a novel state. We define conditions under which each rule evolves to a genetically-polymorphic equilibrium. We find that payoff-biased social learning may evolve under high levels of environmental variation if the fitness benefit associated with the acquired behaviour is either high or low but not of intermediate value. In contrast, both conformist and anti-conformist biases can become fixed when environment variation is low, whereupon the mean fitness in the population is higher than for a population of asocial learners. Our examination of the population dynamics reveals stable limit cycles under conformist and anti-conformist biases and some highly complex dynamics including chaos. Anti-conformists can out-compete conformists when conditions favour a low equilibrum frequency of the learned behaviour. We conclude that evolution, punctuated by the repeated successful invasion of different social learning rules, should continuously favour a reduction in the equilibrium frequency of asocial learning, and propose that, among competing social learning rules, the dominant rule will be the one that can persist with the lowest frequency of asocial learning.},

Comparable tests of sociality and brain size/structure in birds have not been performed, despite marked similarities in the social systems of birds and mammals. Here, we test whether one aspect of avian sociality, cooperative breeding, is associated with an increase in brain size across 155 species of the passeriform parvorder Corvida. Using conventional and phylogeny-corrected statistics, we examined the correlated evolution of relative brain size and: the presence/absence of cooperative breeding, percentage of nests that are cooperative and cooperatively breeding group size. Most of the comparisons yielded non-significant results, which suggests that cooperative breeding is not related to relative brain size in this parvorder. There are a number of potential explanations for our findings. First, changes in brain region size may be correlated with cooperative breeding without affecting overall brain size. Secondly, cooperatively breeding birds might not possess more complex social behaviour than non-cooperatively breeding birds. Thirdly, relatively large brains might be ancestral in this parvorder. This may predispose them to evolve the range of complex behaviours found in this group, including extreme sociality. Finally, ecological and/or developmental factors might play a more significant role than social behaviour in the diversification of avian brain size. Assessing these alternatives requires more information on the neural and cognitive differences between bird species.}

Developmental plasticity frequently involves parental effects, which might enable adaptive and context-dependent transgenerational transmission of phenotypic strategies. However, parent–offspring conflict will frequently result in parental effects that are suboptimal for parents, offspring or both. The fitness consequences of parental effects at evolutionary equilibrium will depend on how conflicts can be resolved by modifications of developmental processes, suggesting that proximate studies of development can inform ultimate questions. Furthermore, recent studies of plants and animals show how studies of parental effects in an ecological context provide important insights into the origin and evolution of adaptation under variable environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression are disproportionately prevalent in women. Women are more likely to experience depression and anxiety disorders during periods of marked hormonal fluctuations, suggesting that gonadal hormones are involved in stress pathology. Depression and anxiety are both associated with aberrant secretion of glucocorticoids, which also show marked fluctuations across the reproductive cycle and in response to gonadal steroids. Thus, interactions between gonadal and stress hormones may play a major role in predisposing females to stress-related disease. The purpose of this brief review is to highlight preclinical data regarding the role of estrogens in depression and anxiety-like behaviors. While it is evident the exogenous estrogens modulate affective behavior in rodents, there is some disagreement in the literature, perhaps related to experimental designs that vary with respect to administration parameters and stress. Beneficial effects of estrogens on mood are most likely due to estrogen receptor (ER)[beta] signaling. The antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of ER[beta] are consistent with its role in attenuating glucocorticoid responses to stress, suggesting that estrogens, acting at ER[beta], may improve mood by suppressing glucocorticoid hyperactivity. However, additional studies demonstrate that ER[beta] signaling in the hippocampus is sufficient to induce antidepressant and anxiolytic behaviors. Thus, ER[beta] may improve mood via primary actions on hypothalamic (i.e., paraventricular nucleus) and/or extra-hypothalamic sites. Overall, the preclinical research suggests that selective ER modulators targeting ER[beta] may be an attractive alternative or adjunct treatment to currently prescribed antidepressants or anxiolytics.},

Captive martens that consumed isotopically labeled glycine exhibited significant and progressive enrichment in the isotopic signature of 13C, 15N and 2H in both whole blood and hair. A distinct mark in hair, \&gt;2 standard deviations above natural abundance, occurred within 14�days of the second dose. The rate of isotopic labeling of hair was higher in spring, possibly because labeled amino acids became diluted among the many hairs growing during the autumn. Because hair and feathers can be collected non-invasively from large geographic areas without capturing animals, this labeling method can be used to mark and study the movement and dispersal rates of animals across landscapes efficiently.},

For comparative proximate analyses we emphasize the need to be explicit about the level of analysis to reveal the type of convergence that has taken place. Although there is evidence that corvids and apes solve social and physical problems with similar speed and flexibility, there is a great deal more to be learned about the representations and algorithms underpinning these computations in both groups. We discuss recent comparative work that has addressed proximate questions at this level, and suggest directions for future research.},

Rank was positively correlated with the more efficient provisioning of offspring and the raising of larger annual broods, but reproductive success and social status were also strongly dependent on age. Our results provided evidence that attributes of dominance (e.g. fighting ability) are valuable for maintaining access to increasingly restricted food supplies.

We related those behavioural traits to dominance status in male chickadees following brief, pairwise encounters. Low-exploring birds (birds that visited less than four locations in the novel room) were significantly more likely to become dominant in brief, pairwise encounters with high-exploring birds (i.e. birds that visited all perching locations within a novel room). On the other hand, there was no relationship between novel object exploration and dominance. Interestingly, novel-room exploration was also not correlated with novel object exploration. These results suggest that behavioural profile may predict the social status of group-living individuals.

We examined our data with respect to two general hypotheses: (1) startled spiders should modulate their boldness according to context-specific variables (e.g. developmental stage, feeding opportunities, mating opportunities, parental investment, body condition, etc.), and/or (2) an individual spider's boldness will be consistent (i.e. positively correlated) across contexts such that boldness in any given context is well predicted by boldness in other contexts. We found some support for the former, context-specific hypothesis and strong support for the latter, [`]behavioural-syndromes' hypothesis. While spiders were significantly bolder in the presence versus absence of prey, boldness did not fluctuate with developmental stage, mating opportunities, parental investment or condition in the manner predicted. Instead, boldness in adult spiders was well predicted by a syndrome of positively correlated bold behaviours across functional contexts. We suggest that animal behaviour most often reflects a combination of context-specific behavioural optimization and context-general expression of behavioural syndromes, as was seen in this experiment. We further suggest that disentangling the relative magnitude of these two general mechanisms in a wide variety of taxa, covering many behavioural-ecological contexts, will provide great insights into (1) population ecology (e.g. the success of invasive/pest species and the failure of threatened species), (2) community ecology (e.g. species coexistence, trophic dynamics), and (3) evolutionary ecology (e.g. evolution of the multivariate behavioural phenotype).},

Results of various studies on FMR have been used to calculate allometric equations that can predict FMR from body weight. One of the problems in calculating these regression equations lies in the treatment of the available FMR and body weight data. However, with the tool of mixed model analysis, it is possible to account for the effect of the study as a random effect in this kind of meta-analysis. The present study is the first that has included the study as a random effect in an FMR meta-analysis. Prediction equations were derived, allowing the estimation of FMR based on body weight. Including all available single animal data on FMR and body mass in a mixed model analysis with the study as a random effect yielded the equation: FMR in kJ�day22121=6.68 � 1.21 (body weight in g)0.67 � 0.03 (P\&lt;0.001) that had a mean error rate of 21.5\% (sd 29.0\%, minimum 0, maximum 236\%) and a coefficient of variation of 98\%. This was c. 2.7 times more precise than not including the study effect (mean error rate 58.4\%).

Such measures are dedicated to tell us about the quality side of ecosystem functionality, e.g. to tell us how well the system performs relatively to a theoretical maximum efficiency possible. As an additional hypothesis, such functions are thought to orient the systems and thus increase through time development, i.e. to be optimised under the given the constraints, through the evolution of the system. Recently is has been pointed out that natural and societal systems share the feature of being complex in their organisation. Meanwhile, it was remarked that societal systems in many ways evolved in opposite direction of how natural evolution would drive an ecosystem. Many philosophers of biology have stated that biological systems posses information and memory functions which improve their long-term capability to survive. This information is believed to be contained in the organisational structures of the system as much as in its gene pool. If we accept such arguments it means that studies of organisation and function of natural systems will provide us with another type of ecosystem services. This would namely give us information about in what direction to drive society in order to achieve a more sustainable system.
This paper discusses what measures derived from modern ecosystem theory can possibly be used to study and compare the functionality of the two types of systems. The discussion takes an entrance point in two graphs--one that represents a natural system and one of a socio-economic system. The systems possess similar levels of complexity in terms of number of compartments whereas their connectivities do differ in quantity and quality. The differences between the systems are compared from both a network and a thermodynamic perspective. Indications of the best available options that we have at present, will help to increase our knowledge about and understanding of the systems given. As a main conclusion it is possible to view and treat our society as an ecosystem. This means that it is possible to apply the same measures (indicators) that we use in ecological theory. The idea to use these features is so clear, obvious and at the same time cheap that this option necessarily has to be tried out. It seems a bit surprising that we - from a "natural science point-of-view" - to a certain extent understand natural systems better than socio-economic ones. One major reason is that the latter type includes a large set of regulatory mechanisms that are exerted on a subjective basis as opposed to natural systems. As a consequence societal systems become much more difficult to evaluate, forecast and regulate than ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Conflicts over food, access to mates, or other limited resources can sometimes escalate into aggression. In species that form social groups, these aggressive conflicts can jeopardize the benefits of group living, such as enhanced access to valued resources, necessitating the development of behavioural mechanisms that either mitigate conflicts, prevent aggressive escalation or resolve disputes. Two important mechanisms for managing the effects of disputes involve postconflict (PC) affiliative behaviour, either between the former opponents (called 'reconciliation') or between one opponent and a third party. Even though numerous studies have tested reconciliatory and third-party affiliation tendencies in primates, for non-primate animals little systematic data are available. We performed behavioural observations on three groups of captive domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and used a PC/MC method to test the existence of reconciliation and third-party affiliation in this species. The results of this study clearly indicate that both reconciliation and third-party PC interactions are present in the domestic dog, and form important social mechanisms of the domestic dog. Furthermore, familiar individuals showed a significantly higher proportion of reconciled conflicts than did unfamiliar individuals, and also displayed fewer conflicts. Finally, we show that most of the third-party affiliations involve the victim of a conflict and that victim-directed affiliation outweighs victim-initiated third-party affiliation in these PC interactions.},

They provide the opportunity to manipulate single or combined visual stimuli selectively, while other potentially confounding variables remain constant. A wide array of different presentation methods of artificial stimuli has been used in recent research. Furthermore, a wide range of basic hardware and software has been used to conduct experiments. The outcomes of experimental trials using computer-manipulated visual stimuli differed among studies. Failing or contradictory results were mostly discussed in a behavioural and ecological context. However, the results sometimes may be basically flawed due to methodological traps in the experimental design. Based on characteristics and restrictions of technical standards, we discuss which kinds of computer stimuli and visual display units are available today and their suitability for experimental trials when studying animal behaviour. A computer-manipulated stimulus displayed by a certain visual display unit may be accurate to investigate behaviour in a specific species, if various preconditions are met. However, simply due to technical characteristics of the visual display unit, the set-up may be unsuitable for other test species. Thus, future research should critically apply the included technique, with respect to both the intended kind of stimulus and the species under investigation. If these preconditions are met, computer-manipulated stimuli provide a high degree of standardization and the potential to display visual signals without losing a crucial amount of information from the native data.},

A single exposure to high intensity predominantly emotional stressors such as immobilisation in wooden-boards (IMO) induces long-term (days to weeks) desensitization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) response to the same (homotypic) stressor, whereas the response to novel (heterotypic) stressors was enhanced. In addition, long-lasting changes in behaviour have been described after a single exposure to brief or more prolonged sessions of shocks, predator, predator odour, underwater stress or a combination of three stressors on 1 day. The most consistent changes are reduced entries into the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and enhanced acoustic startle response, both reflecting enhanced anxiety. However, it is unclear whether there is any relationship between the intensity of the stressors, as evaluated by the main physiological indexes of stress (e.g. HPA axis), the putative traumatic experience they represent and their long-term behavioural consequences. This is particularly critical when trying to model post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), which demands a great effort to validate such putative models.

We used capture2013mark2013recapture models to estimate apparent survival of 31 species from eastern Ecuador based on data collected from 2001 to 2006. Models assuming constant survival had highest support for 27 species; models incorporating effects of transients were highest for four. Average apparent survival across 30 species of passerines was 0.58 (� 0.02 SE); apparent survival was lower during the first interval after initial capture (03C61: mean = 0.49 � 0.03) than during subsequent intervals (03C62: mean = 0.60 � 0.02). Apparent survival was similar among three families represented by at least four species (Thamnophilidae: 0.57 � 0.03, N= 10; Furnariidae: 0.59 � 0.03, N= 5; Pipridae: 0.56 � 0.02, N= 4). There was no indication that species that occur in flocks had higher survival than nonflocking species (obligate flock members: 0.57 � 0.03, N= 10; facultative flock members: 0.56 � 0.04, N= 5; nonflocking: 0.59 � 0.03, N= 15). Comparisons of published estimates of apparent survival of tropical species demonstrated substantial differences among species and, in some cases, within species across different sites in the Neotropics. Our results support previous studies that concluded that early estimates of high (\&gt; 85\%) survival in tropical birds may not be representative of all tropical species. Future studies should focus on understanding factors (e.g., life-history traits) that promote differences in survival among species within tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Data has been assembled on the incidence of allopreening (= mutual preening) in various species, and from this, and from personal observations, views on its causation and function have been derived. The term "allopreening" with its converse "autopreening", was chosen in preference to "mutual preening" to avoid ambiguity; and the terms "non-reciprocal", "reciprocal", and "simultaneous", have been used to describe the type of allopreening. Information was obtained, or observations made, on allopreening in 41 different avian families. In most species it resembles the attention given to plumage during autopreening. Since the presence of plumage does not invariably elicit preening behaviour, the behaviour associated with allopreening was examined for evidence of its causation. It was found to be closely linked with aggressive behaviour, and in many species attack appeared to give way to allopreening, which appeared to be a replacement, or outlet, for it. If allopreening replaces aggression to differing degrees some evidence of the change can be expected. The usual form of attack is pecking at the head. From observations of captive birds it has been found that submissive postures appear to reduce attacks to light pecking, and that when allopreening species respond to attacks of individuals of other species as though this were allopreening the attack is frustrated, and through habituation may decrease until it resembles allopreening. In the cowbirds preening invitation postures have induced allopreening in some species which do not normally show this behaviour. In such circumstances allopreening is considered to be the direct result of the frustration of the aggressive drive and to be displacement behaviour having a similar initial movement. In addition to this there appears to be little evidence that allopreening occurs as a normal form of preening behaviour. When its functional value as preening is examined it is found that although such preening usually occurs on areas of plumage which a bird cannot reach for itself, yet it occurs only in a minority of species; there is no evidence that species which lack it are at any disadvantage, and in many species where it does occur it occupies only a brief part of the breeding period. It does not therefore appear to be of value as plumage maintenance. Preening invitation postures are considered to be postures resulting from thwarted fleeing, appeasing, or withdrawing behaviour, combined with head positions which initially result from attempts to protect the eyes from, or evade, the bill of the preener without moving away. These head positions could function as cut-off postures in which the aggressor ceases to be visible and the tendency to flee is reduced. Allopreening can be regarded as a form of agonistic behaviour in which the normal tendencies of attacking or fleeing, when two individuals are in close proximity, are in conflict with sexual and opposing attacking and fleeing tendencies. In the attacked bird thwarted fleeing will tend to result in a fluffed posture, while the head positions will "cut-off" the aggressor and reduce still further the fleeing tendencies. In the attacking bird the thwarting of the aggressive tendencies by the refusal of the other bird to flee, together with possible sexual and fleeing conflict, will create a situation where displacement behaviour might be expected, and where the confrontation of the aggressor with the raised feathers of the recipient will increase the likelihood of preening behaviour. This behaviour appears to have become fixed and ritualised in some species. An examination of the known incidence of allopreening, which has been summarised for the Families concerned, shows that certain characters reoccur in association with it and may be factors determining its appearance. These are: Restricted site, where two individuals are forced into close proximity either because of the nature of the nest-site or because they cannot move easily on land; Long absence, which might increase aggressive tendencies; Sociability, such as colony breeding or clumping together, involving close proximity; Long pair-bond, where individuals are in each other's company for a long period; Sexual monomorphism, the sexes closely resembling each other with possibilities of non-recognition on first encounter. There factors make it possible to define the type of bird likely to show allopreening. The one outstanding factor is the enforced proximity of the two individuals. In some species there is apparent evidence of allopreening soliciting by males, which might either be a submissive display by a dominant bird reducing the likelihood of aggressive behaviour, or might indicate a change of dominance during a particular period. There are, in some genera where most species allopreen, odd species which do not show it, but which do show special greeting ceremonies on occasions when allopreening might be expected. These ceremonies might be alternative ceremonies replacing allopreening.},

the hypothesis that male meadow voles posses the capacity to recall the “what”, “where”, and “when” of a single past event

two chambers. One chamber contained a day-20 pregnant female (24 h prepartum). The other chamber contained a sexually mature
female that was neither pregnant nor lactating (REF female). Twenty-four hour after the exposure, the males were placed in
the same apparatus, which was empty and clean. At this time, the pregnant female would have entered postpartum estrus (PPE),
a period of heightened sexual receptivity. Males initially chose and spent significantly more time investigating the chamber
that originally housed the pregnant female (now a PPE female) than the chamber that originally housed the REF female. Male
voles also explored an apparatus containing a chamber with a PPE female and one chamber containing a REF female. Twenty-four hour
later, males were placed into an empty and clean apparatus. The males did not display an initial choice and they spent similar
amounts of time investigating the chamber that originally housed the PPE female (now a lactating female) and the chamber that
originally housed the REF female. The results of these and additional experiments suggest that male voles may have the capacity
to recall the “what”, “where”, and “when” of a single past event, which may allow males to remember the location of females
who would currently be in heightened states of sexual receptivity.},

great ape and corvid cognition challenge this belief, the phylogenesis of human planning remains largely unknown. The complex
skill for future planning has not yet been satisfactorily established in any other extant primate species than our own. In
humans, planning for future needs rely heavily on two overarching capacities, both of which lie at the heart of our cognition:
self-control, often defined as the suppression of immediate drives in favor of delayed rewards, and mental time travel, which
could be described as a detached mental experience of a past or future event. Future planning is linked to additional high
complexity cognition such as metacognition and a consciousness usually not attributed to animals. In a series of four experiments
based on tool use, we demonstrate that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo abelii) override immediate drives in favor of future needs, and they do not merely rely on associative learning or semantic prospection
when confronted with a planning task. These results suggest that great apes engage in planning for the future by out competing
current drives and mentally pre-experiencing an upcoming event. This suggests that the advanced mental capacities utilized
in human future planning are shared by phylogenetically more ancient species than previously believed.},

Initially, investigators (Capaldi, 1985; Capaldi et al., 1983) considered this trial 2 differential speed effect evidence for rats' anticipation of inter-trial outcomes within each series. Later findings, however, suggest that this effect reflects some generalization of the ordinal position of trial 3 (Burns et al., 1986) or its similar runway cues during trial 2 (Capaldi et al., 1999). To test these generalization hypotheses, we made trial 2 more distinct from trial 3 in each series by forcing rats to alternate runways in a T-maze only on the last trial rather than on trial 2 in each series in Experiment 1, or by forcing rats to alternate runways between trials rather than to run down the same runway on all trials within each series in Experiment 2. Although enhancing the distinctiveness between these trials reduced the trial 2 differential speed effect, extensive training failed to eliminate it. Therefore, this residual difference between trial 2 speeds could reflect rats' anticipation of trial 3 outcomes during trial 2 as originally proposed by Capaldi (1985) Experiment 3 was designed to determine whether we could enhance rats' final trial outcome expectancies during trial 2 by making different trial 2 choices distinctive cues for each trial 3 outcome. The trial 2 speed effect was greater when rats were forced to alternate over all trials only within one of the series than when they were sometimes forced to do so in either series. Post-training probe tests revealed that both series position and the relevant within-series runway events contributed to this enhanced anticipation of trial 3 outcomes.},

	abstract = {Chronic nutritional stress can have a negative impact on an individual's learning ability and memory. However, in social animals that share food among group members, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), it is unknown whether group-level nutritional stress is manifested in the learning performance of individuals. Accordingly, we examined learning and memory in honey bee workers reared by colonies exposed to varying degrees of long-term pollen stress. Pollen provides honey bee workers with almost all of the proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals that they require as larvae and adults. Colonies were created that were either chronically pollen poor or pollen rich, or were intermediate in pollen supply; treatments altered colonies' pollen stores and brood-rearing capacity. Workers from these colonies were put through a series of olfactory-conditioning assays using proboscis-extension response (PER). PER thresholds were determined, then workers learned in olfactory-conditioning trials to associate two floral odors (one novel and the other presented previously without reward) with stimulation with sucrose and a sucrose reward. The strength of the memory that was formed for the odor/sucrose association was tested after olfactory-conditioning assays ended. Colony-level nutritional status had no effect on worker learning or memory (response threshold of workers to sucrose, acquisition of the odor/sucrose association, occurrence of latent inhibition, or memory retention over 72�h). We conclude that potential effects of chronic, colony-wide nutrient deprivation on learning and memory are not found in workers, probably because colonies use brood-rearing capacity to buffer nutrient stress at the level of the individual.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Planning, the internal process of formulating an organized method about one’s future behavior, should be advantageous for
non-human animals as well as for humans. However, little is known about this process in avian species. We examined planning
processes in pigeons (Columba livia) using a computerized maze task. In Experiment 1, we found that the pigeons plan their next one step, and in some cases even
correctly adjust their actions after change of goal locations, while performing on a plus-shaped maze. We also showed that
the pigeons might even plan two steps on familiar, well-practiced mazes. In Experiment 2, we discovered that the subjects
plan the direction they would go first before starting to solve a four-arm shuriken (a Japanese traditional throwing knife)-shaped maze. The birds also corrected their previously planned actions after change
of goal locations. Our results from these experiments suggest that planning ahead is within the cognitive capacity of a “bird
brain”, and that it may be more widespread in the animal kingdom than has been presumed.},

	abstract = {Birds are the only taxonomic group other than mammals that exhibit high-amplitude slow-waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.},

	abstract = {One of the most novel foraging strategies in Neotropical birds is army-ant-following, in which birds prey upon arthropods and small vertebrates flushed from the forest floor by swarm raids of the army-ant Eciton burchellii. This specialization is most developed in the typical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) which are divisible into three specialization categories: (1) those that forage at swarms opportunistically as army-ants move through their territories (occasional followers), (2) those that follow swarms beyond their territories but also forage independently of swarms (regular followers), and (3) those that appear incapable of foraging independently of swarms (obligate followers). Although army-ant-following is one of the great spectacles of tropical forests, basic questions about its evolution remain unaddressed. Using a strongly resolved molecular phylogeny of the typical antbirds, we found that army-ant-following is phylogenetically conserved, with regular following having evolved only three times, and that the most likely evolutionary progression was from least (occasional) to more (regular) to most (obligate) specialized, with no reversals from the obligate state. Despite the dependence of the specialists on a single ant species, molecular dating indicates that army-ant-following has persisted in antbirds since the late Miocene. These results provide the first characterization of army-ant-following as an ancient and phylogenetically conserved specialization.},

In the social setting we focussed on the effects of social relationships on social facilitation during the approach to novel objects. We tested 11 hand-raised ravens with novel objects individually at three and six months of age and in dyadic combinations at six months of age. Individuals were consistent over development and contexts in their response to different novel objects. Birds joined siblings faster to approach novel objects than non-siblings. They also spent more time sitting close to siblings than to non-siblings. In male-male dyads but not in female-female dyads, subordinates approached the novel objects significantly faster than dominant birds. In contrast, dominant males were the first to approach the novel objects in mixed-sex combinations. Hence, the effect of social context seems to depend on the social relationships towards the companions and on the combination of the sexes.},

Here we studied how diet innovation and cultural change relate to cultural inheritance in a changing environment. We did this by studying diet cultures in group foragers adapting to environmental change through learning, and the consequences this has for diet differentiation between groups. We used an individual-based model of [`]monkeys' that learn what to eat in a rich environment, and we changed resource species that are available in the environment. Relative to social influences on learning that arise spontaneously in groups, we found that more direct social learning, in the sense of observing another individual and copying what it eats, helps groups deal with high levels of environmental variability by generating greater group level incorporation of diet [`]innovations' and enhancing cumulative cultural diet improvement. An important factor for the dual role of copying in diet innovation and cultural inheritance is how copying is mediated by foraging opportunities in the environment in the short term. During adaptation to environmental changes, groups diverge in diet. This is caused by differences in learning history and is increased when individuals copy each other, but this depends on migration. Furthermore, when groups live together in the same environment and compete for resources, diet differentiation is enhanced through what appears to be culturally mediated character displacement.},

Forty-five 2-month old Sprague Dawley rats were fed ad libitum for 52 weeks on a powdered diet that was either sugar-free or contained 7.9\% sucrose or 10\% honey (which is the equivalent amount of sugar). Anxiety levels were assessed using an Elevated Plus Maze, whilst a Y maze and an Object Recognition task were used to assess memory. Locomotor activity was also measured using an Open Field task to ensure that differences in activity levels did not bias results in the other tasks. Anxiety generally decreased overall from 3 to 12 months, but the honey-fed rats showed significantly less anxiety at all stages of ageing compared with those fed sucrose. Honey-fed animals also displayed better spatial memory throughout the 12-month period: at 9 and 12 months a significantly greater proportion of honey-fed rats recognised the novel arm as the unvisited arm of the maze compared to rats on a sugar-free or sucrose-based diet. No significant differences among groups were observed in the Object Recognition task, and there appeared to be no differences in locomotor activity among groups at either 6 or 12 months. In conclusion, it appears that consumption of honey may reduce anxiety and improve spatial memory in middle age.},

Song learning evolved independently in at least six groups of animals, and movement imitation in three (great apes, cetaceans and psittacine birds). The cladogram also involves at least eight new processes: abstract concept formation, percussive mimicry, cross-modal imitation, apo-conditioning, hybrid conditioning, proto-pantomime, prosodic mimicry, and image-mediated learning. At least eight of the processes evolved from more than one source. Multiple sources are of course consistent with modern evolutionary theory, as seen in some obligate symbionts, and gene-swapping organisms.

From initial studies of estrogen effects on salt and water intake in the 1970s and later investigations of the role of estrogen in cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function, it has become increasingly clear that body fluid volume and osmotic regulation are affected by estrogen. In the early 1990s, estrogen receptors were identified throughout the central nervous system, in areas including circumventricular organs that detect humoral signals associated with body fluid challenges, and hypothalamic and hindbrain nuclei involved in behavioral, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular responses to body fluid challenges. Taken together, the body of evidence amassed from more than 40 years of investigations suggests that the central actions of estrogen influence body fluid regulation and, more specifically, compensatory responses to perturbations of osmotic or volume balance in two interrelated ways. Estrogen alter the detection of signals by the central nervous system and, at the same time, act within central pathways to modify neurotransmitter systems that mediate specific responses to osmotic or volume challenges. This review focuses on the central actions of estrogen in influencing the cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and behavioral processes that subserve body fluid regulation.},

To bring out functional contrasts that are independent of absolute size, we have normalized brain component sizes to whole brain volume. The set of such volume fractions is the cerebrotype of a species. Using this approach in mammals we previously identified specific associations between cerebrotype and behavioral specializations. Among primates, cerebrotypes are linked principally to enlargement of the cerebral cortex and are associated with increases in the complexity of social structure. Here we extend this analysis to include a second major vertebrate group, the birds. In birds the telencephalic volume fraction is strongly correlated with social complexity. This correlation accounts for almost half of the observed variation in telencephalic size, more than any other behavioral specialization examined, including the ability to learn song. A prominent exception to this pattern is owls, which are not social but still have very large forebrains. Interpolating the overall correlation for Archaeopteryx, an ancient bird, suggests that its social complexity was likely to have been on a par with modern domesticated chickens. Telencephalic volume fraction outperforms residuals-based measures of brain size at separating birds by social structure. Telencephalic volume fraction may be an anatomical substrate for social complexity, and perhaps cognitive ability, that can be generalized across a range of vertebrate brains, including dinosaurs.},

Among the information-theoretic indices, AICu is the most consistent with the sequence-based likelihood ratio test. The confidence in model selection by the indices can be evaluated by bootstrapping. I illustrate the usage of the indices and the approximate significance test with both empirical and simulated sequences. The tests show that distance matrices from protein gel electrophoresis and from genome rearrangement events do not violate the molecular clock hypothesis, and that the evolution of the third codon position conforms to the molecular clock hypothesis better than the second codon position in vertebrate mitochondrial genes. I outlined evolutionary distances that are appropriate for phylogenetic reconstruction and dating.},

We examined the developmental stability of single behaviours (activity in an unfamiliar environment, aggressive behaviour and boldness under predation risk) and correlations between these behaviours in two Californian populations of three-spined sticklebacks. Individually marked fish were measured for all three behaviours at three points during development, as juveniles, subadults and adults. Even though single behaviours were unstable through time, some correlations between behaviours were stable. For example, in one population, neither boldness nor aggression was stable but the positive correlation between them was. Certain correlations between behaviours were apparent at some developmental stages but not others, and the pattern of correlations differed between the two populations. These data suggest that behavioural syndromes do not necessarily limit behavioural plasticity, and suggest that ecological and developmental circumstances might favour different suites of traits.},

Many researchers have considered how biased data may affect their ability to draw conclusions and examined ways to decrease bias in sampling efforts, but few have addressed the implications of not considering estimate precision. We propose a method to assess whether the number of instantaneous samples collected is sufficient to obtain precise activity budget parameter estimates. We draw on sampling theory to determine the number of observations per animal required to reach a desired bound on the error of estimation based on a stratified random sample, with individual animals acting as strata. We also discuss the optimal balance between the number of individuals sampled and the number of observations sampled per individual for a variety of sampling conditions. We present an empirical dataset on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) as an example of the utility of the method. The required numbers of observation to reach precise estimates for pronghorn varied between common and rare behaviors, but precise estimates were achieved with \&lt;255 observations per individual for common behaviors. The two most apparent factors affecting the required number of observations for precise estimates were the number of individuals sampled and the complexity of the activity budget. This technique takes into account variation associated with individual activity budgets and population variation in activity budget parameter estimates, and helps to ensure that estimates are precise. The method can also be used for planning future sampling efforts.},

Parental survival was independent of social dominance, and the frequency of extrapair fertilizations in jackdaws is negligible.

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that correlated behavioural traits, or behavioural syndromes, influence behavioural evolution in some taxa. Few studies, however, investigate whether the effects of a syndrome are the same for both sexes. We test whether variation in social tendency, inferred from interindividual distance, is correlated with other aspects of behaviour in male comb-footed spiders, Anelosimus studiosus. We compared these results to those from previous studies on female social tendency to determine (1) whether both sexes share the same behavioural syndrome and (2) whether its effects on mating success are the same for both sexes. Trait types in the syndrome analysis include foraging behaviour, antipredator behaviour, exploratory behaviour and activity level. Our results suggest male A. studiosus, like females, can be categorized into two social classes: an aggregative (social) class and an intolerant (asocial) class. Social males (i.e. those with lower interindividual distance scores) were generally less aggressive towards prey and predators, and were less active. Furthermore, we provide evidence from a parent/offspring breeding study for an additive genetic component to male social tendency (heritability = 0.32). To determine the influence of the male syndrome on mating success, we performed staged male-male contests between social and asocial males for access to females. We found that male social tendency was the single best predictor of success in these trials, with asocial males outperforming social. This finding is opposite to the trend observed in female A. studiosus, where social females experience higher mating success. We propose that the diametrically opposed mating outcomes between the sexes could generate evolutionary conflict.},

	abstract = {aSchool of Psychology, University of St Andrews, Scotland Variations in brain size and proportions can be linked to the cognitive capacities of different animal species, and correlations with ecology may give clues to the evolutionary origins of these specializations. Much recent evidence has implicated the social domain as a major challenge driving increases in problem-solving abilities of mammals. However, the methods of measurement available to researchers are often indirect and sometimes appear to give conflicting answers, and other intellectual challenges may also have been influential in cognitive evolution. While the cause of an evolutionary increase in intelligence may be domain-specific (sociality, for example), and the brain specialization that results may largely implicate a single perceptual system, such as vision, the intelligence shown in consequence can be very ‘general-purpose’ (as in primates and some avian taxa). Future research needs to get beyond vague ascription of ‘greater intelligence’ or ‘faster learning’ towards a precise account of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie particular mental skills in different species; that will allow theory-testing against data from complex, natural situations as well as from the laboratory, on a common metric.   There are, of course, quite a lot of assumptions in this simple account. The variables — intelligence, cognitive challenges of social life and ecology — cannot be measured directly, so measurable things (such as brain size, group size, range area, and so on) have had to be used as proxy variables: do these really represent what they are supposed to represent? Sociality is treated as varying along the simple scale of total group size, but there are many reasons why an animal might be social: do these all have equivalent effects? Certainly it makes sense that a larger brain reflects a greater need, but what is ‘large’: large in absolute number of neurons or large in comparison to the animal's overall body dimensions [2]? The brain has an immense range of functions, and function does not necessarily map neatly onto neural structure: can the particular areas, whose enlargement appears to result from selective pressures to solve social problems, be distinguished from overall scaled increases [13]? Usually, the tightest correlations have been found between social group size and the neocortex, an area that is conspicuously enlarged in several groups of large-brained mammals, including primates, carnivores and cetaceans. Does it thus make sense to treat the neocortex as the ‘thinking part’ of the mammalian brain? Not all of these issues can be decided on present evidence, but we return to several of them later in this review. We begin, however, by explaining the ‘social intelligence’ theory in more detail, in order to examine the extent of its success in understanding the evolution of advanced cognition. Then, because other cognitive challenges may also have caused increases in brain capacity, we ask: is social intelligence separable from general intelligence, and what cognitive mechanisms constitute the rather vague idea of ‘intelligence’ in non-human animals? Group living has many possible advantages for animals, most obviously in minimizing predation (by increased vigilance or dilution of risk) or allowing cooperation (in locating food or hunting prey). But living in close proximity to conspecifics also has clear disadvantages, in terms of direct resource competition. The tension between aggregation and dispersal is vividly illustrated in the daily fission–fusion behaviour of baboons (Papio papio) living in arid Sahel habitats that they share with a range of predators [14]. At night, aggregations of hundreds of baboons sleep together, but when foraging, these groups split up into tiny parties of three to eight individuals, efficiently re-aggregating in the heat of the day at shady drinking places by homing in on loud calls from other subgroups [15]. This separation and re-joining of groups allows each individual to benefit from the dilution effects of ‘being one in a crowd’ when most vulnerable to predation [16], while reducing competition at food patches. Permanent group living is thus a demanding evolutionary option, as resource competition tends to disrupt group stability: in mammals, however, there are several taxa — such as primates, cetaceans and carnivores — in which long-lasting social groups are regular and conspicuous. The key is that an individual that can use its intelligence to acquire resources by stealth or cooperative tactics may be able to retain the benefits of group living on a more permanent basis. Niccolo Machiavelli famously recommended politicians to use social manipulation for individual profit, hence the term ‘Machiavellian intelligence’ for the idea that social manipulation has been favoured in animal evolution [17]. (Note that, as Machiavelli himself pointed out [18], the most effective manipulator is often the most trustworthy, cooperative and respected member of society: the synonym ‘social intelligence’ emphasises these pro-social traits, but ultimately the genetical benefit is a selfish one.) Critically, it is argued, other individuals present a ‘moving target’ of continually changing behaviour, able to respond to the self's strategies with their own [5]: social complexity presents an inherently greater intellectual challenge than environmental complexity. The logic of this theory will only apply if a social group is a semi-permanent aggregation: not all sociality is cognitively demanding. Temporary groupings, such as flocks of non-breeding ducks on lakes, migrating herds of ungulates, or fish schools attacking krill are not predicted to have any such selective effect on intelligence. Similarly, multi-species groups, such as the huge assemblies regularly found in tropical bird species, can provide predator protection by vigilance and dilution, whilst minimizing the costs of competition since different species will tend to occupy somewhat different feeding niches [19]. Aggregations which are both temporary and multi-species have even been noted: for instance, baboons and impala associate together, and here the different perceptual strengths of a primate and an ungulate may give additional advantage in avoiding stealth predation. As with Neotropical bird flocks, diet difference helps minimize competition, reducing the cost of association compared to the case of long-lasting groups of conspecifics. Enticingly, most reports of apparently ‘smart’ behaviour in mammals come from the relatively few species that are semi-permanently social, consistent with the social intelligence proposal. Unfortunately, comparative psychology has found no acceptable ‘intelligence’ test for animals' [20], so researchers have turned to measures of brain size to further examine the effects of sociality. Positive correlations have been found between mean social group size and neocortex volume (whether measured in absolute terms, or in proportion to the size of the rest of the brain) in all mammalian groups that have so far been examined systematically [8], [9], [10] and [11]. Moreover, in catarrhine primates (Old World monkeys and apes), group size also correlates with the amount of time individuals spend in social grooming [8] and [21], suggesting that these primates need to spend more time building up networks of potential allies if they live in larger groups. And just occasionally, there has been an opportunity for direct assessment of animals' use of social manipulation, for instance in the case of primate tactical deception, where data were amassed from many studies over a wide range of species [22] (Figure 1). Of course, observer-effort tends not to be uniform across species, and frequencies of deception needed to be corrected for effort. Then, deception was found to be well predicted by neocortex volume but not affected by rest-of-brain volume [23]. These three facts have led to widespread acceptance of the theory that a major evolutionary stimulus to brain enlargement in social mammals has been the need for a larger neocortical area to facilitate more effective social manipulation, including the need to keep track of a complex network of social relationships [24], [25] and [26]. The high costs of investment in brain tissue mean that, when a brain is large in relation to lean body mass, it is a sign of strong selection for problem solving of some kind [27]. Over longer evolutionary time-scales, however, this effect may disappear: relatively large brains are a serious liability, inevitably resulting in evolutionary pressure for increased body size. Whether such change will indeed happen depends on other environmental circumstances, of course; the metabolic demands of flight, for instance, will make increasing body size disproportionately costly for birds and bats, and more generally metabolic rate will constrain brain size [28]. Brain size relative to body size is not a good measure of cognitive power, because like any computational system the brain's power is ultimately dependent on absolute number of components. Artificial computing systems are also limited by computing speed, but this may be less important in vertebrate brains. True, nerve conduction speed varies with the diameter of myelinated fibres, and fibres are relatively thin in the toothed whales and elephants, whose brains contain as many cortical neurons as those of humans despite the higher cell packing density of human neurons [29]. Thus these very large mammals may have been somewhat liberated from any evolutionary pressure for neural efficiency; but in general it is perhaps safest to assume brain parameters are computationally optimal for a given brain's size and organization. Thus, some measure of absolute size is more likely to index animal intelligence [27] and [30]. In comparative studies of the mammalian neocortex, several different measures have produced mutually consistent results: absolute volumes, with rest-of-brain volume as a control variable; ratios in linear proportion to rest-of-brain; residuals of scaling function between neocortex and rest-of-brain [8] and [31]. To find which source of environmental complexity best predicts variations in species' brain size, it is necessary to make some rough-and-ready estimates of the problems animals face. As we have seen, the usual approach is to treat the mean size of semi-permanent groups as an indication of the social challenge. The logic is that, if the problems arise from ‘other people’, then the severity of problems must increase at least linearly with the number of others that one lives with. (In fact, animals may never socialize with every other group member, restricting their efforts at building up alliances to a smaller clique. But clique size has been shown to increase with mean group size, so the approximation is fair [32].) However, if a particular species has a more refined cognitive understanding, then individuals of that species may have a lot more to notice and remember about others than members of a less discerning one: so there is an element of circularity. Monkeys, at least, recognize other group members as individuals, by their voices and their appearance [33]; they know who is close kin to whom, and who outranks whom [34] and [35]; they recall and repay favours by their allies [36], [37] and [38]; they invest grooming time building up a network of reliable allies, and make an effort to reconcile with those allies if they should come into conflict [39] and [40]; and they notice whether interactions among third parties follow the ‘usual’ rules of who is dominant or submissive to whom [41]. For these species, then, memory load for social information becomes very significant as group size rises (Figure 2). For primates, the major alternative theory that has been tested against Machiavellian intelligence is that of ecological cognition. Primates generally must build up an adequate nutrition from dispersed, largely vegetable foods in complex tropical environments. It has been argued that remembering where the key resources are and when they fruit poses a significant intellectual challenge [42] and [43]. In addition, some foods are hidden, embedded in substrate or inedible casing, and specialization on embedded foods has also been suggested to require more imagination than eating foods open to direct perception [44] and [45]. However, when proxy variables have been devised to estimate the extent of the environmental memory problem — day journey length, home range area, proportion of embedded foods — they have not been found to correlate with species brain size [46] and [47]. Admittedly, frugivorous primates have systematically larger home ranges, and larger brains for their body size than folivorous ones [48]. But this effect may reflect selection for larger bodies in folivorous species, rather than larger brains in frugivorous ones [27]. Specializing on coarse, leafy material requires a large or compound gut, inevitably tending to make the body large. Species pairs that differ in this way, like the gorilla and the more frugivorous chimpanzee, have closely similar brains but very different body weights. As noted above, using brain size relative to body size is a good way of estimating the strength of evolutionary selection pressure (and thus the need for a large brain), but no way to judge the cognitive potential of the brain. There is little current evidence that memory for food — the cognitive map hypothesis — has contributed greatly to the evolution of large brains among mammals. Another ecological theory has yet to be fully evaluated. This is that a key cognitive challenge was to ensure successful hunting (by predators) and avoidance of predation (by prey) [49]. As with Machiavellian intelligence, predator–prey interactions have the property of a ‘moving target’: the individuals that present the problem are continually acting and reacting in order to thwart the other. And since the result may involve death the likely selection pressure on mental mechanisms that give any cognitive ‘edge’ is very great. There are a number of suggestive facts in favour of this theory. Jerison showed that the relative brain size of successive radiations of Holarctic carnivores and ungulates increased steadily from the Paleocene to the Pliocene, apparently in tandem but with the relative brain size of carnivores always slightly ahead of that of ungulates [2]. In contrast, the Neotropical herbivores of the same period, in a continent that lacked significant mammalian predators, showed no such systematic increase in brain size over time. In a natural experiment, the cranial fossils of a Majorcan bovid showed a striking drop in brain size after its only mammalian predator died out (Figure 3) [50]. And among living species, the most complex systems of representational communication yet discovered, in monkeys, function to enable highly specific predator warnings to be given to other group members [51]. Social living, therefore, gives these monkeys extra benefits in predation reduction, on top of any ‘selfish herd’ dilution effects, when the group becomes a cooperative machine for outwitting the predator. Unfortunately, estimating predation pressure is generally nigh-on impossible in most environments: predators are, by the nature of their livelihood, hard to find and count. Moreover, teasing apart cognitive effects that result from predator–prey interaction from those that result from within-group social problem solving will be particularly tricky when the ultimate, functional reason for group living is often the minimization of predation, anyway [52]. And apart from primates, many of the social mammals that show particularly large brains are also themselves predators, for example carnivores and toothed whales [53]. (At least one social carnivore, the spotted hyena, even displays remarkably monkey-like social organization [54].) At present, it must be admitted that no broad, comparative analysis points to predation as a major source of cognitive advance in evolution; but it would probably be unwise to dismiss the idea. In principle, the most rigorous test of the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis would be to compare the cognitive skills of a social animal with those of a non-social, matched ‘control’ species — one that is closely related, ecologically similar, and so forth — and repeat this exercise for many such matched pairs. This approach is fraught with problems of finding appropriate control species, however. How closely related should these species be? How similar should the niches the species occupy be in order to claim comparable ecological challenges? And arguably the most difficult to reconcile: what tests or measures can be used fairly and reliably to compare the cognitive skills of the different animals? Tests must be ecologically valid and physically possible for all species under comparison. But such species-fair tests of animal intelligence are, as we have noted, currently non-existent. In the face of these difficulties, the most productive approach so far has been very different: the meta-analysis of written reports of behaviour [55], comparing well-defined but broad categories of behaviour, such as tactical deception, tool using and behavioural innovation. These analyses have allowed comparisons of the behavioural flexibility of many species at once, illustrating how the use of ‘smart’ behaviour varies predictably with social group size and neocortex size, at least in primates. The emphasis on primates is currently inevitable, but more reports of pertinent behaviours from other species should become available as interest in cognition spreads among zoologists. Moreover, increasing understanding of brain organization in non-mammalian taxa should allow use of the comparative method to track evolutionary pressures on the functional subsystems of their brains. This should ultimately allow a broader understanding of the origins of vertebrate cognition. As we have noted, brain tissue is metabolically costly; also, the need for energy to be supplied to the brain is remorseless — even a short interruption causes loss of tissue — and increased head size may cause other adverse effects, such as birth difficulties in viviparous species. Large brains are perhaps best avoided, then, and if they are essential for living in semi-permanent groups we might expect vertebrate sociality to be rare. This indeed seems to be the case: in amphibians, reptiles and fish, aggregations are usually temporary or absent. Convincing reports of advanced cognition are scarce in any of these species, consistent with the presumption that they can deal with environmental problems in ways that do not rely on the flexibility for which cognitive mechanisms are needed. (The cognitive abilities of some coral-reef fishes [56], [57] and [58] are a conspicuous exception to this generalization, and may prove to be a convergent case of selection for Machiavellian intelligence in a socially complex community of many sympatric species.) Even in birds, most species are socially monogamous (even if breeding is colonial) and single-species flocks are usually seasonal or ephemeral. To the extent that there is any variance in semi-permanent group sizes of birds to examine, it is not a good predictor of brain size [59]. It would therefore be tidy to report that birds, like other non-mammalian vertebrates, lack signs of specialization in advanced cognition. This is not the case, however. Two avian taxa stand out, the parrots and the corvids, both in manifest intelligence and in brain size — relative to body size and, for the larger species, in absolute terms. Extensive experimentation with an African grey parrot, Alex, has revealed an impressive range of abilities: referential use of spoken words, understanding of number, use of relative concepts and same/different judgements, and so on [60]. The even larger brained cockatoos and macaws have yet to be examined for cognitive capacities, but the tiny spectacled parrotlet has been found to label specific individuals vocally [61]. Among corvids, remarkable abilities have been found in a range of species [62]. Clark's nutcrackers make several thousand caches of pine seeds each autumn, and retrieve them over the winter and spring. In the laboratory, they have consistently outperformed other, non-storing birds in spatial memory tasks [63]. Scrub jays take account of the decay-rates of cached food of different types when deciding which of their caches to excavate and consume [64]; they take account of the viewing opportunities of competitors when deciding where to cache [65]; they re-cache food in new places, if competitors might have seen their original cache sites [66]; and they take account of which individual competitors have seen them make caches, when deciding which to consume first or re-cache in private [67]. Ravens use competitor's gaze direction when hiding food, distinguish between knowledgeable and ignorant competitors, and use several tactics to deceive them about location of foods [68] and [69]. Rooks readily learn to retrieve food from a tube with a gravity-trap in it, whereas monkeys have proved inept at similar tasks [70]. These impressive abilities are not obviously related to the birds' degree of sociality: rooks are colonial and feed in temporary feeding flocks, scrub jays may live in extended families, ravens are monogamous but form flocks as juveniles, whereas grey parrots and nutcrackers are monogamous and rather solitary species. Even where birds show social manipulation, it is directed at outsiders rather than group members. While the social problem solving needed to live in a large group may be an important stimulus to cognitive development, it is clearly not the only one. At a more general level, the repeated need to deal competitively with minds — minds of familiar social companions in a long-lasting social group, minds of observant and perhaps individually known competitors in a crowded foraging environment, or minds engaged in the life-and-death struggle of predation — may always select for greater cognitive ability. Wrestling with other minds guarantees that only highly flexible, responsive mechanisms confer real advantage. Thus, rather than being seen as competing, mutually exclusive hypotheses for the evolution of intelligence, the Machiavellian intelligence of social living and the cut-and-thrust of predator–prey relations may be just two facets of the same thing. If the advantage gained from efficient and skilful social manipulation does indeed lead to enlargement of all or part of the brain, is the outcome a brain specialized for social problem solving, but perhaps inept at other cognitive tasks? This question resonates with an old debate in psychology: is intelligence a single propensity to deal with all kinds of information efficiently, or are there different ‘intelligences’ for different skills? That historic debate cast the question in terms of whether a single number, the value of ‘g’, describes a person's intelligence, or is intelligence modular, so that each module might be more or less advanced [71]. It must be admitted that psychology did not settle the matter for human psychometrics, largely because the discussion often degenerated into advocacy of rival statistical methods. However, because the differences in ability between different species may be expected to be on a larger scale than the subtle interpersonal variance within humans [72], it may be possible to make more progress. Looking at positive evidence of cognitive sophistication in animals, many of the most striking cases certainly concern social understanding and social manipulation: several examples have been given already. The ability of monkeys, in particular, to notice and communicate about very subtle social nuances has been set in stark contrast to their seeming ineptitude in reacting to the physical world [35]. Critical in this debate were a series of experiments simulating the presence of bizarre natural history events — for example, a hippopotamus calling from a desert area — or physical cues to the presence of a dangerous predator — such as an antelope body draped over a branch, characteristic of leopard kills, or a broad straight groove in the sand, characteristic of a large python track. Vervet monkeys showed no interest in any of these set-ups, even those apparently signalling the presence of their major predators [73]. But it is famously difficult to make firm deductions from negative evidence — maybe the monkeys were able to detect the falseness of the set-ups, or maybe making dramatic reactions to every sign of a predator would be counter-productive. More recent work, showing that monkeys use the referential calls of other species, and use memory to reason which danger is actually present when they hear ambiguous alarm calls, brings into serious question the proposal that monkeys are poor at natural history [74], [75] and [76]. Rather, perhaps it is their closed repertoire, especially their apparent inability to acquire new motor patterns for their hands — compared with the great apes, whose manual repertoire seems productive and open [77] and [78], and who readily develop skilful tool-use — that restricts the ways in which they are able to show their understanding of the physical world. The broad, comparative approach that showed neocortex size to be a good predictor of social manipulation might seem to point to the neocortex as a module of social intelligence. But in fact a large neocortex has been found to correlate with frequency of other signs of intelligence in primates: learning from companions, tool use, and innovation in behavioural repertoire [79]. It looks as if neocortex size, for primates at least, is best seen in terms of ‘g’ rather than a specifically social module [80]. Selection for social manipulation may be what led to the development of large brains, but the resulting problem-solving abilities have pay-off in quite other areas. Advanced cognition also appears domain-general in corvids, rather than restricted to food-getting and food-storing domains. Partnerships in rooks and jackdaws share some of the characteristics of primate alliances [59], including reciprocal aid and postconflict affiliation [81], and like monkeys, pinon jays can learn another bird's rank from third-party observation alone [82]. The evolutionary origin of these social skills is unlikely to be the challenge of social living, as we have noted, because the tell-tale correlation of brain enlargement and social group size is missing. It must be admitted that comparative analyses of brain evolution are still in their infancy. Birds have a very different brain organization to that of mammals, with whom they most recently shared an ancestor over 250 million years ago, and identifying homologous structures in bird and mammal brains is fraught with difficulty. Researchers attempting direct comparison with mammals thus often find disorder [83]. Where orderliness has been found, however, it is measures of innovation frequency and the use of objects as tools, derived from meta-analysis of an extensive amateur literature, that show clear relation to brain enlargement in birds [84] and [85]. Any convergence between corvids and primates must therefore be at the level of domain-general intelligence. In the case of parrots, whose range of abilities again suggests a domain-general intelligence but which are only very distantly related to corvids, lack of knowledge of natural behaviour prevents informed speculation on the evolutionary origin of their intellectual abilities. ‘Greater intelligence’ and ‘advanced cognition’ are terms used freely in discussions of sociality and brain enlargement: but to a large extent they function as hedges, avoiding commitment to which particular cognitive mechanisms the animals in question are displaying. Without cooperative subjects under verbal instruction in a cognitive psychology laboratory, it may indeed be very hard to say; but in this final section we make an attempt to sketch what cognitive mechanisms are minimally implied by the data on social intelligence. The enterprise would be aided by a more sophisticated approach to understanding the mental processes involved in complex behaviour, replacing the blanket approach of ‘learning’ by one in which the particular cognitive systems of different species are modelled [86], so that individual cognitive components can be compared across species: working memory, selective attention, episodic memory, anticipatory planning, and so on. At present, we must begin with a simpler question: how far can variation between species be understood in terms of worse/better, and at what point do we need to invoke a richer understanding of the organization of animal minds. The fact that many data sets show a continuous range of differences, in brain size and in frequencies of cognitively impressive behaviour, points to cognitive enhancements that are ‘more of the same’, rather than re-organization of cognitive architecture or the introduction of entirely new systems. The highly social animal will certainly require a discriminating perceptual system, in order to distinguish those subtle cues that enable many different individuals to be recognized, and to identify nuances of facial expression, body posture or vocal timbre that indicate mood and disposition [31] and [87]. Social perception includes the selective attention mechanisms that allow a sustained focus on key areas for picking up relevant information, and avoid distraction by irrelevance. We know from human experience how powerful this sort of perception can be, even applied to novel stimuli: for instance, researchers in one long-running study regularly recognize individually almost all individuals of a population of 1200 elephants. What we do not know is how ‘costly’ it is in brain tissue: but ‘visual’ processing takes up large areas of human cortex, extending far beyond the visual area of the occipital lobe, so this may have made a major contribution to brain enlargement [31]. Primates are specialized for vision, but in other highly social mammal groups different perceptual systems may dominate: most dramatically, sonar in toothed whales and bats. In addition to perceptual specializations, the complexities of social living may require more powerful means to register and employ knowledge. Large-brained, Old World monkeys can learn about other's rank and kinship from third-party observations alone [88], and many instances of subtle social manipulation by deception must have required learning from rare, if not unique, past events [89] and [90]. Very rapid learning, at least in social situations, is therefore another aspect where brain enlargement may increase efficiency of a primitive ability of all vertebrates. Moreover, knowledge about a substantial number of individuals, their typical interactions, and the history of who can be relied upon, must be learned from past events in order to respond appropriately in social interactions within a large monkey group (or, presumably, a higher-order dolphin alliance, or a wild dog pack), or to ‘network’ within a social milieu made of many alliances. This would not be possible with a long-term memory system that was circumscribed or inefficient. As Sir Bob Geldoff famously remarked after the first Live Aid concert: “Is that it?” Well, for most animals, we suspect yes. It is tempting to describe the social manoeuvring of non-human primates — reconciliation, alliance formation, tactical deception, referential communication — in human-like terms, as if the animals construed their actions as we do, planned them in advance and understood their modus operandi. A closer look at what these social skills involve suggests otherwise. Enlargement of mammalian neocortex confers abilities of highly discriminating perception, rapid learning in social contexts, and efficient long-term memory. The great bulk of the ‘smart’ social tactics of non-human primates and other species can be understood solely in these terms [17] and [91]. Indeed, a great deal of everyday human cognition is entirely based on sophisticated perception, rapid learning and extensive memory, though we sometimes retrospectively glamorize our actions in more richly intentional terms [92]. Everyday human experience in the social realm, however, indicates that there is further to go. For instance, we can work out what someone is likely to do next, not just on the basis of their past history with us and their current demeanour, but by working out what they know and believe: ‘social attribution’, or ‘theory of mind’. Whether any non-humans can do this remains somewhat controversial, not least because it is not entirely clear how we do it ourselves! A number of ‘theory of mind’ tests, devised with pre-verbal children in mind, have been ‘passed’ by (for instance) chimpanzees and corvids [67] and [93]. It can be argued, however, that much of our everyday social attribution is carried out by sophisticated, unconscious statistical extraction of overt but subtle information [94], [95] and [96]. It may be that we only more rarely carry out mental deductions about others' minds, and that doing so entails much more ‘work’ cognitively and requires language. Much the same argument may be made in the physical realm, where the highly efficient use that some non-human animals make of the physical world — including tool use, tool making, and dealing with mechanical and gravitational forces — may at root be based on an unconscious, statistically derived understanding of the complex world they live in, rather than the kind of propositional knowledge that one learns in school science classes [97]. The \$64,000 question is probably: ‘Can animals plan for the future?’ It is not unthinkable that non-linguistic animals are locked into present perceptions and past memories, and that all their achievements are managed without their ever thinking about what happens next [98] and [99]. Finding out definitively, rather than ‘failing to disprove the null hypothesis’ of inability, is a tall order, especially so when it comes to social cognition. If crows, dolphins, chimpanzees or meercats contemplate tomorrow, and work out social strategies on the basis of these anticipations, they have no easy way to tell us. And indeed, if their companions' demeanour or intervening events made their best-laid plans infeasible, the plans would no doubt be aborted: and observers would conclude that memory and perception were all that was determining their behaviour. While the jury is firmly out on whether animals make social plans, it may be possible to make more progress in other realms. And, as we have seen, it is most likely that advanced cognition — even if it resulted from selection purely in the social realm — has domain-general effects, so we should look more widely. Travel, in a familiar but large-scale environment — an area that cannot be scoped from a single viewpoint — is intrinsically about the future: animals set off ‘towards’ places that cannot be seen, and will not be reached until time has passed. If it can be shown that they set off with intent to reach those places, then we can be sure they are able to plan in anticipation and conceive of absent things and future events. Recent research has shown that some large-brained, Old World monkeys show just this kind of ability when choosing where to forage. Mangabeys take account of recent past weather when deciding when unripe figs may be worth revisiting. That is, when they come close to a tree that has previously not been a good source of food but showed promise, their decision to go for it or not depends on the weather of the last several days, not just the weather of the day in question [100]. Baboons take account of the likely risk of other troops exploiting their prized resources. They make sure they head first to distant foods that invite exploitation by competing groups even when it means by-passing perfectly good food of other kinds, food that they return to eat later in the day [101]. In both cases, the animals must be computing future events that might take place at out-of-sight locations, and taking decisions accordingly. The food-caching of some corvid species provides another arena in which advance planning would pay, and scrub jays show caching tactics that serve to increase the likelihood that the cache will be undiscovered, but only if they themselves have experience of pilfering other birds' caches [66]. Moreover, they cache food in places that anticipate their future needs and likely local shortage [102]. It is sometimes argued that ‘real’ anticipatory planning necessarily involves decision-making about a future in which the individual is in a different motivational state to its present one [98]. This seems to muddle cognitive skills with the occasion of their use, and moreover the conjecture is more-or-less untestable in natural environments; but perhaps the ability to imagine, specifically, one's own future bodily state might be a uniquely human one? It is not. Under controlled captive conditions, scrub-jays preferentially cache food of a type that they will value highly in the future, even when their current motivation to eat that food is low [103]. At least some animals, therefore, may also be using anticipatory planning in their social strategizing [104]: perhaps future studies will be able to home in upon such skills, currently seen as the province only of humanity. Comparative analysis of brains has advanced from using gross measures of total brain or major lobe volume: it is now accepted that evolution has acted independently on coordinated, functional systems [31]. Comparative cognition needs to make a similar transition. Categories as broad as ‘learning speed’, ‘perceptual efficiency’, ‘memory capacity’ and ‘anticipatory planning’ are inherently unsuitable for comparing the details of cognitive ability between different species of animal: they reduce all differences to more/less, yes/no judgements, without helping to explain how the tasks are actually performed. Within closely related groups of animals, or in species with limited, primitive abilities, it has been possible to finesse the details of information processing and thus use continuous measures of ‘ability’ to evaluate evolutionary theories. To go further in understanding those abilities, and especially when attempting to understand the advanced cognition that has arisen in widely-divergent groups of animal — primates, dolphins, parrots, crows — it becomes necessary to build theoretical models of the abilities themselves. Animal learning theory has proceeded independently from human psychology for the last four decades [105], unaffected by the ‘cognitive revolution’. Learning theorists remain deeply reluctant to proliferate intervening variables if ‘association’ can be invoked, yet are little concerned at the explanatory adequacy of their theories. Notoriously, broad appeals to association learning are liable to lack adequacy as working explanations [106]. Precise models of information processing can be posed in terms of associations and tested in carefully controlled conditions. However, only quite simple situations can be examined in this way, meaning that ‘animal cognition’ risks always being seen as concerning the simple, unlike the rich complexity of human abilities. If we are instead to begin to understand the evolutionary origins of that human intelligence, it will be necessary to evaluate data from the inconveniently messy environments in which animals evolved — in the same terms as data from the neat world of the laboratory. Modelling abilities in cognitive terms, rather than as a mass of associations, allows testable models of process to be constructed relatively easily even in complex situations [86], making that more likely to happen. We thank Phil Barnard and Nathan Emery for their kind efforts which have greatly sharpened up an earlier version of this paper, and Meike Köhler for allowing us to use her illustration of Myotragus brain size.},

Although chimpanzees and other social species may negotiate conflicting interests regarding travel direction or activity timing, very little is known about their ability to negotiate conflicting preferences over food. In the current study, we presented pairs of chimpanzees with a choice between two cooperative tasks--one with equal payoffs (e.g., 5-5) and one with unequal payoffs (higher and lower than in the equal option, e.g., 10-1). This created a conflict of interests between partners with failure to work together on the same cooperative task resulting in no payoff for either partner. The chimpanzee pairs cooperated successfully in as many as 78-94\% of the trials across experiments. Even though dominant chimpanzees preferred the unequal option (as they would obtain the largest payoff), subordinate chimpanzees were able to get their way (the equal option) in 22-56\% of trials across conditions. Various analyses showed that subjects were both strategic and also cognizant of the strategies used by their partners. These results demonstrate that one of our two closest primate relatives, the chimpanzee, can settle conflicts of interest over resources in mutually satisfying ways--even without the social norms of equity, planned strategies of reciprocity, and the complex communication characteristic of human negotiation.},

In the laboratory, some animals can learn the specific duration (seconds or minutes) between periods of food access [2]. It has been supposed that wild nectarivores, such as hummingbirds, might also learn short time intervals so as to avoid revisiting emptied flowers until the nectar has been replenished [3]. We provided free-living, territorial rufous hummingbirds each with eight artificial flowers containing sucrose solution. Four flowers were refilled 10 min after the bird emptied them, and the other four were refilled 20 min after being emptied. Throughout the day, birds revisited the 10 min flowers significantly sooner than they revisited the 20 min flowers, and return visits to the flowers matched their refill schedules. Hummingbirds remembered the locations and timing of eight rewards, updating this information throughout the day. Not only is this the first time that this degree of timing ability has been shown in wild animals, but these hummingbirds also exhibit two of the fundamental aspects of episodic-like memory (where and when 4 and 5), the kind of memory for specific events often thought to be exclusive to humans 6 and 7. Author Keywords: SYSNEURO Many important events in animals' lives, from the availability of food to the arrival of predators, occur predictably in time, and many animals are able to gauge the intervals between these events [e.g., 2 and 8]. Timing abilities range in scale from animals varying activity levels according to events (such as the predictable onset of dawn and dusk) to anticipating the availability of food over shorter intervals. Other events, however, have a far less predictable periodicity and, in the case of nectarivores feeding on renewing food sources, the periodicity is, to a large extent, dependent on their own actions. Because emptied flowers might take several hours to replenish, hummingbirds could save time and energy by avoiding them. To do this, the bird should remember not only where the flower was, but also when it was last visited. Territorial rufous hummingbirds avoid recently emptied flowers by remembering where the flowers were 9 and 10, and traplining hummingbirds show some evidence of being able to track temporal changes 11 and 12. This experiment was designed to determine whether free-living rufous hummingbirds could remember when they had visited a number of artificial flowers (see Figure 1), which were then refilled at intervals of either 10 or 20 min after being emptied. After a number of days, we compared the timing of the birds' visits made to both 10 and 20 min flowers. Visits were defined as probes made by the bird to individual flowers within a foraging bout. The intervals between visits to each flower were calculated for each experimental session. Frequency distributions of all “postreinforcement pauses” (PRPs), the intervals between a bird's current visit to a flower and its last rewarded visit to that flower, were then constructed (Figure 2). Because interbout intervals were determined by the birds, and tended to be less than 10 min (Bird 1: 8 min; Bird 2: 10 min; Bird 3: 6 min), birds had frequent opportunities to visit all the flowers and yet decline visits to flowers that had been emptied during the recent foraging bouts. The patterns of visitation to the array support three primary inferences. The first is that birds learned that the refill rates differed among the flowers. Birds revisited the 10 min flowers significantly sooner than they visited 20 min flowers (Mann Whitney U tests, adjusted for ties: Bird 1, n = 2271; Bird 2, n = 2504; Bird 3, n = 3277; p {\textless} 0.0001 in all three cases). Critically, the PRPs for 10 min flowers were significantly shorter than the value 20 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: p {\textless} 0.001 in all three cases), indicating that the birds avoided the 20 min flowers when they returned to the array sooner than 20 min after the previous bout. Given that all of the flowers differed in their color and pattern and they were not arranged by refill rate, it seems that the birds do not use relative familiarity of the array to determine which flowers should be visited 13 and 14. The second inference that can be drawn from these data is that the hummingbirds learned that the specific refill times were 10 and 20 min. Whereas many studies indicate that animals anticipate rewards, and indeed many of the individual hummingbird PRPs were shorter than the refill rate, the birds' central tendency was to match or exceed the refill rate. Not one of the median values was shorter than the refill rate (Wilcoxon 1-tailed, 1-sample tests, 10 minutes: Bird 1, median = 14 min, n = 1231; Bird 2, median = 13 min, n = 1361; Bird 3, median = 12 min, n = 1933; for all, p {\textless} 0.001; 20 minutes: Bird 1, median = 20 min, n = 1050, p = 0.51; Bird 2, median = 21 min, n = 1143, p = 0.001; Bird 3, median = 20 min, n = 1344, p = 0.07). An alternative measure of central tendency is the mode. Modal PRPs matched refill rates very closely (10/20 min flowers: Bird 1: 11/21 min; Bird 2: 10/20 min; Bird 3: 10/20 min; Figure 2). Finally, the hummingbirds distinguished between 10 min and 20 min flowers, in general, and they also seem to have remembered specifically which flowers they had emptied recently. Such abilities have been shown only in laboratory experiments in which animals receive extensive training. Not only were the hummingbirds able to learn the refill schedules, as shown in other animals in the laboratory, but more remarkably, the hummingbirds were also able to update this information across numerous foraging bouts throughout the day. Such updating abilities have rarely been demonstrated in any animal. It is to be expected that animals increase their responding rate in concert with reinforcement rate when faced with concurrent choices offering different rates of reward (the matching law 15, 16 and 17). All birds visited 10 min flowers significantly more frequently than 20 min flowers (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: all p {\textless} 0.004). Ten minute flowers were not, however, visited twice as often as 20 min flowers (ratio of visits to 10:20 min flowers: Bird 1: 1.08, Bird 2: 1.20, Bird 3: 1.43; all tested against H0 = 1, all p {\textless} 0.004; tested against H0 = 2, all p {\textless} 0.001). Such a deviation from strict matching is, however, also common to other studies 18 and 19. Across days, birds varied in how well their visits matched the refill schedule. From the first session onward for all three birds, their visits to the 10 min flowers always matched, or exceeded, 10 min. In contrast, revisiting of the 20 min flowers took a little over two sessions before the PRPs were consistently around 20 min or longer (Figure 3). Given that they visited these flowers less frequently than the 10 min flowers, it is perhaps not surprising that it took the birds longer to learn the refill schedule. This is also consistent with the finding that longer intervals are harder to time than shorter ones (see e.g., [20]), as a result of increased uncertainty in estimating longer intervals [21]. However, this should also result in the standard deviation of timing an interval being proportional to the magnitude of that interval (see e.g., [16]), which was not the case for any of the birds: Although the coefficients of variation did not differ between the two refill rates (paired t test: t = 1.37, p = 0.31, df = 2), the standard deviations (SDs) for 10 min were significantly different from those for 20 min (mean SD10 = 8.14, mean SD20 = 11.18; t = 6.69, p = 0.02, df = 2). All the birds learned the two intervals more readily, if not quite as accurately, as animals trained in the lab, and the birds timed the 20 min refill flowers better than would have been expected. It must also be remembered that these birds were both “in control” of the experiment and constantly occupied with other important behaviors throughout the experiment, such as displaying to females and guarding their territory against intruding conspecific males. Their timing ability seems all the more impressive given these competing calls on their attention and time. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that free-living animals remember both the locations of multiple rewards and when they visited each of those locations. Additionally, in order to continue doing this accurately through the day and between days, the birds had to be able to update their memories continually for each flower. Because natural flowers differ in nectar level and concentration, and hummingbirds are able to remember each of these [22], they may well be able to remember all three components of a flower (where, when, and what). Territorial hummingbirds would, then, like food-storing birds, appear to make use of episodic-like memories in their everyday lives 23 and 24. Although there are both rat and primate episodic-like-memory models in which the animals remember the what and where of an item or event 25, 26, 27 and 28, it is the temporal component of a memory that has been difficult to demonstrate (25 and 29, but see [30]). Keeping track of the timing of past events is, however, a constant part of daily life for a foraging, territorial hummingbird. The timing abilities of these birds, thus, provide a useful contribution to the current debate on episodic-like-memory processes and whether or not they exist in animals other than humans. The subjects used in this experiment were three wild, male rufous hummingbirds. The experiment was run from 0800–2000 hr Mountain Standard Time in June and July 2000 in a valley in the eastern Rocky Mountains, Alberta, Canada. Rufous hummingbirds migrate to this valley to breed, and males set up territories centered around artificial feeders. It took 1–2 hr to train each bird to feed from artificial flowers, containing sucrose, placed in his territory. A flower consisted of a white cardboard disc (6 cm diameter), mounted horizontally on a wooden stake (60 cm high). At the center of the flower was a blue syringe tip (capable of holding 120 μl) in a small cork mounted on top of the stake. When the bird was consistently feeding from these flowers, the experiment began. At the start of a day's testing, the bird's feeder was removed and an array of eight flowers was placed in his territory, in the same place for each session. The array consisted of eight flowers in a 3,2,3 configuration with a nearest-neighbor distance of 60 cm. The flowers were the same as in training except that each was of a different color (neon green, orange, blue, brown, purple, yellow, green, red). Each flower contained 20 μl (concentration 20\%) sucrose solution. Once the bird had visited the array for the first time, two different fixed-interval flower refill schedules were used. Four flowers were designated as 10 min flowers, i.e., each was refilled 10 min after the bird had emptied that flower, the other four as 20 min flowers, i.e., refilled 20 min after being emptied. The locations of 10 and 20 min flowers within the array were determined in a pseudorandom fashion and remained the same throughout the experiment. The male was free to visit flowers throughout the day. At the end of each session, the array was removed and the bird's feeder replaced. Small markers were placed in the ground to ensure that in subsequent sessions the array was put back in the same place. The time of the bird's visits to the array and the flowers visited in each bout were recorded throughout each session. The total number of bouts varied across birds (Bird 1, 536 bouts across 13 sessions; Bird 2, 495 bouts across 11 sessions; and Bird 3, 695 bouts across 12 sessions). To ensure that the results we observed above were not an artifact of the birds' repeatedly using the same visiting strategy, one that happened to interact with our experimental refill rate, which could then lead to a bias in the temporal distribution of the data, we also repeated all of the analyses by using only the data from the first visit birds made to a flower following their last rewarded visit (the first PRP). However, although there were many fewer data, of the outcomes reported above, the only difference seen between the two data measures is that the birds returned to the 20 min flowers sooner than 20 min. Nonetheless, they still returned to 10 min flowers significantly sooner than to the 20 min flowers.

	abstract = {Researchers studying animal societies often begin by testing whether a population shows nonrandom social structure, by comparing observed social associations with the predictions of a null model. Association data comprises observations of individuals in groups, which are observed through repeated surveys. Each survey is conducted on a discrete occasion, for example, within 1 day or 1 week. Current null models randomize the interactions among individuals, while preserving two key elements of the data: the number of times that each individual has been seen, and the sizes of observed groups. A critical assumption of existing permutation methods is that each observed group is independent. However, this assumption is often violated. Typically, researchers search a large study area, relative to the distances moved by animals within the sampling occasion. Thus, most individuals will not have had opportunity to change their group associations during a sampling occasion. We show how randomization tests should be modified to account for this nonindependence of group membership. We generated association data sets in which we randomly assigned individuals to groups. We tested these data sets for nonrandom structure using the generally accepted [`]trial swap' algorithm. We found that spurious conclusions of nonrandom structure occur when we allowed permutation of individuals across sampling occasions, but not when we [`]blocked' the data by sampling occasion, and constrained our randomizations to permute individuals only among groups within each block.},

A multi-tasking framework which reliably evokes stress and also includes performance measures was used to induce acute stress in the laboratory. Using a randomised crossover design forty participants (mean age 21.98 years) performed on the multi-tasking framework at two intensities (on separate days) both while chewing and not chewing. Order of workload intensity and chewing conditions were counterbalanced. Before and after undergoing the platform participants completed the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Bond-Lader visual analogue mood scales, a single Stress Visual Analogue Scale and provided saliva samples for cortisol measurement. Baseline measures showed that both levels of the multi-tasking framework were effective in significantly reducing self-rated alertness, calmness and contentment while increasing self-rated stress and state anxiety. Cortisol levels fell during both levels of the stressor during the morning, reflecting the predominance of a.m. diurnal changes, but this effect was reversed in the afternoon which may reflect a measurable stress response. Pre-post stressor changes ([Delta]) for each measure at baseline were subtracted from [Delta] scores under chewing and no chewing conditions. During both levels of stress the chewing gum condition was associated with significantly better alertness and reduced state anxiety, stress and salivary cortisol. Overall performance on the framework was also significantly better in the chewing condition. The mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown but may involve improved cerebral blood flow and/or effects secondary to performance improvement during gum chewing.},

Although these preferences are critical determinants of the foraging niche and have important ecological and evolutionary implications, we know little about how they develop. Here, we use detailed longitudinal data from meerkats (Suricata suricatta) to examine how individual learning and the use of social information affect the development of foraging microhabitat preferences. Despite living in an open, arid environment, adult meerkats frequently foraged at the base of vegetation. Young pups seldom did so, but their foraging microhabitat choices became increasingly adult-like as they grew older. Learning about profitable microhabitats may have been promoted in part by positive reinforcement from prey capture. Foraging may also have become increasingly targeted toward suitable locations as pups grew older because they spent more time searching before embarking on foraging bouts. The development of microhabitat preferences might also have been influenced by social cues. Foraging in close proximity to adults may increase the probability that pups would dig in similar microhabitats. Also, pups often dug in holes created by older individuals, whereas adults never dug in existing holes. Foraging in existing holes was no more profitable to pups than creating their own foraging hole but could provide pups with important informational benefits. The integration of personal and social information is likely to be a common feature in the development of the foraging niche in generalist species.},

During the search for its neural substrates, the hippocampus has attracted a lot of attentions. Yet, it is not yet possible to induce a pure episodic-like memory deficit in animal studies without being confounded by impairments in the spatial cognition. Here, we present a lesion study evidencing direct links between the hippocampus CA3 region and the episodic-like memory in rats. In a spontaneous object exploration task, lesioned rats showed no interaction between the temporal and spatial elements in their memory associated with the objects. In separate tests carried out subsequently, the same animals still expressed abilities to process spatial, temporal, and object recognition memory. In conclusions, our results support the idea that the hippocampus CA3 has a particular status in the neural mechanism of the episodic-like memory system. It is responsible for combining information from different modules of cognitive processes.},

These two species show a sex difference in relative hippocampal volume (males larger than females), although there are no reports of sex differences in storing behaviour.

	abstract = {Cultural traits spread via multiple mechanisms among individuals within social groups, including via transmission biases that occur when subordinates copy from dominants (prestige transmission), or via common cultural trait variants that are favoured over rare ones (consensus transmission). Most animal populations are subdivided into social groups where cultural learning occurs, yet theoretical studies of cultural trait transmission have tended to focus on within-group transmission dynamics. We developed an agent-based model of cultural transmission in socially structured populations in which a trait arises in one individual and either persists until a stable population equilibrium is reached, or goes extinct. With this model, we systematically varied group size, rates of dispersal among groups, mortality rates, transmission characteristics, the benefit of the cultural trait (including possibly negative benefits), and whether individuals disperse locally or randomly. We used generalized linear models to examine how changes in these parameters influence trait extinction, equilibrium prevalence and time to equilibrium. Four traits increased the probability of extinction: smaller group size, higher background mortality, lower transmission rate and more costly traits (although costly traits sometimes reached an equilibrium). Local dispersal and biased transmission mechanisms (prestige and consensus) had no significant effects on extinction probability, and similar patterns were found for equilibrium prevalence. We found that a lower dispersal rate and local dispersal slowed the time required for a trait to reach equilibrium, as did smaller groups, lower transmission rates and lower costs. Collectively, these analyses reveal that prestige and consensus transmission have weaker effects than other factors associated with demographic and social conditions.},

Schizophrenic patients are mainly characterized by no reliable change in odour sensitivity and by a deficit in odour identification, recognition and discrimination. Depressed patients principally exhibit a deficit in the hedonic aspects of this perception, even if, in some case, alterations in sensitivity or identification are also found. Changes in odour perception are also found in dementia and in some neurodegenerative disease, but in this case alterations concern all aspects of the sensorial experience (detection threshold, identification and recognition).

Lines bidirectionally selected for exploration show a wide array of social and non-social behavioral differences, and also some differences in physiological parameters. Line differences in these characteristics and their relationships show significant temporal consistency. The results show a surprising similarity between the great tit and a rodent model, suggesting a fundamental principle in the organization of behavioral profiles. The nature of this principle and whether or not it is multi-dimensional is discussed. However, the similarity with a chicken model is less clear, which points to some caution for generalization. The epigenesis of great tit behavioral profiles is discussed. Selection experiments with replication and backcrosses reveal a strong genetic basis, and suggest an influence of maternal effects. Ontogenetic manipulations indicate strong developmental plasticity, suggesting adaptive adjustment to prevailing environmental circumstances. They also show that behavioral characteristics belonging to the same profile can become uncoupled. Finally, field data on several fitness parameters of the different personalities in wild great tits are summarized. These data suggest that variation in selection pressure in time and space and assortative mating are plausible mechanisms accounting for the maintenance of different behavioral profiles within the same population.},

In fact, some authors have claimed that the high rates of postconflict affiliation reported in captive studies could represent an artifact of captivity. I explored the claim and conclude that it is unjustified. I argue that the dichotomy captivity vs. wild is conceptually meaningless and scientists should abandon it as an explanatory variable, that differences across studies both in setting-related variables and in the methods used for assessing postconflict affiliation reduce the strength of comparisons within and across settings, that the empirical evidence thus far available neither allows adequate assessment nor supports any claim that links the rate of postconflict affiliation to captivity or wild conditions, and that studies conducted in both settings may be equally useful—and should be used—to test theoretically relevant hypotheses regarding the causes and predictors of variation in postconflict affiliation. Instead of asking the title question, I would ask which variables influence postconflict affiliation and then whether the variables are really associated only with one of the two settings.},

We used a population of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) that cache acorns from four oak species. Tannin activity in acorns was measured by protein precipitating ability (PPA). Logistic regression models accurately predicted frequency of acorn caching among the oak species, using frequency of usable acorns and PPA loss during burial as predictor variables. Among the four oak species, frequency of caching increased with both increasing frequency of undamaged acorns at peak harvest time, and increasing loss of PPA during burial. Other regression models accurately predicted frequency of undamaged acorns for each species, using green acorn PPA and buried acorn PPA as predictor variables. Among the four oak species, frequency of usable acorns tended to increase with increasing green acorn PPA, and decreased with buried acorn PPA. We suggest that a deterrent effect of tannins on insect larvae is responsible for the differences in frequency of acorns usable to jays among oak species, and that jays select acorns for burial by assessing insect damage. Species differences in PPA change during burial probably reinforce this pattern of scrub-jay caching behavior.},

Social dominance was strongly associated with clutch sex ratio, with the difference in clutch sex ratio between the most and least dominant pairs being 30-40\%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an association between social dominance and sex allocation in birds. However, the direction of this effect varied between years. Dominant jackdaws produced more sons during the first years of the study but fewer sons during the last years. Offspring sex was not related to laying order within a clutch, and the effect of social dominance on sex ratio was similar on eggs laid first, middle, or last. We investigated the effect of 2 factors (laying date and parental condition) that could have mediated the shift in the effect of social dominance on sex allocation in the course of the study. Laying date was positively associated with the proportion of males, but this effect was independent of social dominance. Maternal condition (residual mass over tarsus and egg volume) was related to social dominance but not to clutch sex ratio. Paternal condition (residual mass over tarsus) was not related to clutch sex ratio. We discuss how spatial or temporal variation in effects of variables such as social dominance on sex allocation can contribute to our understanding of the evolution of sex allocation in species with complex life histories.},

Using photo identification and behavioral calf follows, we examined patterns of adult-infant interactions for 23 sperm whale calves in the Sargasso and Caribbean Seas. Although multiple individuals of both sexes escorted the calves, the system of escorting differed between the 2 sites. For all calves studied in the Caribbean, we found that 1 female provided most of the allocare but did not nurse the calf, whereas in the Sargasso, multiple females provided care for, and nursed, the young. We discuss differences between populations that may have resulted in the observed differences in these 2 systems of allocare and how these findings fit with current hypotheses on the roles of kin selection and reciprocal altruism in cooperative care in mammals.},

	abstract = {Dominance interactions (supplantings) of 26 jackdaws (Corvus monedula) living in a captive flock were recorded for a period of 2 years. The transitivity of the dominance hierarchy did not increase over time. Though there were 238 rank changes in course of the study, a portion of 6 \% of all possible triads of the flock was always intransitive. Only 16.5\% of the observed supplantings involved aggressive behaviour. There was no significant correlation between the body weight of a jackdaw and its dominance rank. Male-Male dyads had a disproportionally high frequency of dominance interactions and rank changes. Females were more likely to gain in rank in course of a rank change if their mate was already dominant to the opponent and to lose in rank if their mate was subordinate to the opponent. With the males there was no such tendency. Only 5.4\% of the observed dominance interactions were temporary reversals with respect to the defined dominance relationship of a dyad. The probability of temporary reversals was increased if the mate of the supplanting jackdaw was present (less than 60 cm away) during the dominance interaction even though it did not interfere. When it was present, it joined the supplanting interaction in 10.0\% of the cases. Breeding jackdaws had an increased percentage of reversed dominance interactions in front of their nest box. This site-related dominance was especially marked as soon as the female started to incubate.},

	doi = {10.2307/4533105},
	abstract = {Data has been assembled on the incidence of allopreening (= mutual preening) in various species, and from this, and from personal observations, views on its causation and function have been derived. The term "allopreening" with its converse "autopreening", was chosen in preference to "mutual preening" to avoid ambiguity; and the terms "non-reciprocal", "reciprocal", and "simultaneous", have been used to describe the type of allopreening. Information was obtained, or observations made, on allopreening in 41 different avian families. In most species it resembles the attention given to plumage during autopreening. Since the presence of plumage does not invariably elicit preening behaviour, the behaviour associated with allopreening was examined for evidence of its causation. It was found to be closely linked with aggressive behaviour, and in many species attack appeared to give way to allopreening, which appeared to be a replacement, or outlet, for it. If allopreening replaces aggression to differing degrees some evidence of the change can be expected. The usual form of attack is pecking at the head. From observations of captive birds it has been found that submissive postures appear to reduce attacks to light pecking, and that when allopreening species respond to attacks of individuals of other species as though this were allopreening the attack is frustrated, and through habituation may decrease until it resembles allopreening. In the cowbirds preening invitation postures have induced allopreening in some species which do not normally show this behaviour. In such circumstances allopreening is considered to be the direct result of the frustration of the aggressive drive and to be displacement behaviour having a similar initial movement. In addition to this there appears to be little evidence that allopreening occurs as a normal form of preening behaviour. When its functional value as preening is examined it is found that although such preening usually occurs on areas of plumage which a bird cannot reach for itself, yet it occurs only in a minority of species; there is no evidence that species which lack it are at any disadvantage, and in many species where it does occur it occupies only a brief part of the breeding period. It does not therefore appear to be of value as plumage maintenance. Preening invitation postures are considered to be postures resulting from thwarted fleeing, appeasing, or withdrawing behaviour, combined with head positions which initially result from attempts to protect the eyes from, or evade, the bill of the preener without moving away. These head positions could function as cut-off postures in which the aggressor ceases to be visible and the tendency to flee is reduced. Allopreening can be regarded as a form of agonistic behaviour in which the normal tendencies of attacking or fleeing, when two individuals are in close proximity, are in conflict with sexual and opposing attacking and fleeing tendencies. In the attacked bird thwarted fleeing will tend to result in a fluffed posture, while the head positions will "cut-off" the aggressor and reduce still further the fleeing tendencies. In the attacking bird the thwarting of the aggressive tendencies by the refusal of the other bird to flee, together with possible sexual and fleeing conflict, will create a situation where displacement behaviour might be expected, and where the confrontation of the aggressor with the raised feathers of the recipient will increase the likelihood of preening behaviour. This behaviour appears to have become fixed and ritualised in some species. An examination of the known incidence of allopreening, which has been summarised for the Families concerned, shows that certain characters reoccur in association with it and may be factors determining its appearance. These are: Restricted site, where two individuals are forced into close proximity either because of the nature of the nest-site or because they cannot move easily on land; Long absence, which might increase aggressive tendencies; Sociability, such as colony breeding or clumping together, involving close proximity; Long pair-bond, where individuals are in each other's company for a long period; Sexual monomorphism, the sexes closely resembling each other with possibilities of non-recognition on first encounter. There factors make it possible to define the type of bird likely to show allopreening. The one outstanding factor is the enforced proximity of the two individuals. In some species there is apparent evidence of allopreening soliciting by males, which might either be a submissive display by a dominant bird reducing the likelihood of aggressive behaviour, or might indicate a change of dominance during a particular period. There are, in some genera where most species allopreen, odd species which do not show it, but which do show special greeting ceremonies on occasions when allopreening might be expected. These ceremonies might be alternative ceremonies replacing allopreening.},

Experiments in the laboratory determined that marsh tits return accurately to the sites of stored sunflower seeds 3 h and 24 h after storage. The proportion of returns exceeded chance encounter and initial preferences for those sites. The lack of interocular transfer in birds for some visual tasks provided a test for the hypothesis that memory is used to relocate stored food. After storing food with one eye covered, marsh tits did not return to storage sites when using only the [`]naive' eye, but did so when using only the eye uncovered during storage. It seems likely that recovery of stored food by marsh tits and other birds occurs by memory of storage sites, not by chance encounter during foraging.},

While cannibalism is the sole evolutionary outcome when the population is well-mixed, both cannibalism and parental care can be evolutionarily stable if the population is viscous. Our analysis allows us to make two main technical points. First, we present a method to define invasion fitness in class-structured viscous populations, which allows us to apply adaptive dynamics methodology. Second, we show that ordinary pair approximation introduces an important quantitative bias in the evolutionary model, even on random networks. We propose a correction to the ordinary pair approximation that yields quantitative accuracy, and discuss how the bias associated with this approach is precisely what allows us to identify subtle aspects associated with the evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations.},

Performance results have been consistent at the level of averaged data, whether obtained from between-participant studies using across-trials averaging (yielding one data point per person), or using across-subject within-trials averaging (yielding 1 data point per trial). The present study was designed to explore this relationship at the individual level. A repeated continuous performance task (CPT) was used with normal adults. Reaction time performance at each target in the first block was considered relative to the corresponding target in the second block. Skin conductance level (SCL) was recorded during the task as an index of arousal at each target. Activation at each target in the first block was calculated by subtracting the level of arousal at the corresponding target in the second block. The relationship between first-block performance enhancement and activation in different participants followed different trends. Some participants showed the traditional inverted-U relationship, and some showed the opposite trend. In line with our previous studies, the average linear relationship over all participants was positive. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to sport performance enhancement.},

A decrease in the amount of available food reduced the mean flock size, the proportion of birds that had access to food, and their mean pecking rate. A decrease in the number of patches, on the other hand, reduced only the proportion of birds that had access to food. The number of choughs foraging was not influenced by food competition but depended only on the number visiting the site. Females competed less well than males: when food was made scarce, they frequented the site in the same proportion as did males, but had less access to food. I suggest that in this social corvid, long-term advantages to flocking related to social bonds, such as the maintenance of pair bonds, may compensate for short-term costs such as a reduction in foraging efficiency.},

Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours.

In species that form social groups, these aggressive conflicts can jeopardize the benefits of group living, such as enhanced access to valued resources, necessitating the development of behavioural mechanisms that either mitigate conflicts, prevent aggressive escalation or resolve disputes. Two important mechanisms for managing the effects of disputes involve postconflict (PC) affiliative behaviour, either between the former opponents (called 'reconciliation') or between one opponent and a third party. Even though numerous studies have tested reconciliatory and third-party affiliation tendencies in primates, for non-primate animals little systematic data are available. We performed behavioural observations on three groups of captive domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and used a PC/MC method to test the existence of reconciliation and third-party affiliation in this species. The results of this study clearly indicate that both reconciliation and third-party PC interactions are present in the domestic dog, and form important social mechanisms of the domestic dog. Furthermore, familiar individuals showed a significantly higher proportion of reconciled conflicts than did unfamiliar individuals, and also displayed fewer conflicts. Finally, we show that most of the third-party affiliations involve the victim of a conflict and that victim-directed affiliation outweighs victim-initiated third-party affiliation in these PC interactions.},

There are two major contexts in which adults engage in play fighting - with juveniles and with other adults. The least attention has been given to adult-adult play. However, one pattern that has been noted by several authors is that the most commonly occurring context of adult-adult play fighting is during courtship, and that this is more likely to occur in solitary species. Supposedly, such play could function to overcome the aggressiveness of potential pairmates unfamiliar with one another, or as a means of evaluating mate quality by one or both partners. By contrasting the presence and degree of play fighting during courtship with the degree of male-female familiarity, the hypothesis that the former is influenced by the latter is tested. Data on 35 species of primates, from 15 families, were compiled from the literature and compared using a method of independent contrasts that incorporates information on phylogenetic relationships. A significant regression was found, with the degree of male-female familiarity accounting for 40\% of the variance in courtship play. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that play fighting in courtship is influenced by male-female patterns of association. However, the data also indicate that other factors must influence the occurrence of play fighting amongst adults, not only during courtship, but also in nonsexual contexts. The broader context of adult-adult play in mammals is discussed.}

Three hypotheses were evaluated: (i) that play occurring in non-sexual social contexts is a byproduct of its use in sex; (ii) that the occurrence of play is related to its use for social assessment and manipulation, and so is more likely to be present in species with reduced familiarity between individuals; and (iii) that phylogenetic affiliation influences the likelihood that species within clades engage in play. We used independent contrasts to test the first two hypotheses, and both were significant, with the presence of play in sexual contexts accounting for 14-16\% of the variance of play in non-sexual contexts, and reduced social familiarity accounting for 30-40\% of the variance in the occurrence of play in non-sexual contexts. To test the third hypothesis, we mapped the occurrence of both types of play onto known phylogenies. The overlap was not congruent, indicating that phylogenetic relationships did not account for the distribution of play. Given that play in both sexual and non-sexual contexts was more likely to occur in species with a social organization involving reduced frequency of contact between the sexes and other social group members, we suggest that the likely adaptive value of play fighting is as a tool for social assessment and manipulation. The possible factors that mitigate the use of play fighting for these purposes, such as the availability of other forms of communication that could serve similar functions, are discussed.}

Few studies, however, investigate whether the effects of a syndrome are the same for both sexes. We test whether variation in social tendency, inferred from interindividual distance, is correlated with other aspects of behaviour in male comb-footed spiders, Anelosimus studiosus. We compared these results to those from previous studies on female social tendency to determine (1) whether both sexes share the same behavioural syndrome and (2) whether its effects on mating success are the same for both sexes. Trait types in the syndrome analysis include foraging behaviour, antipredator behaviour, exploratory behaviour and activity level. Our results suggest male A. studiosus, like females, can be categorized into two social classes: an aggregative (social) class and an intolerant (asocial) class. Social males (i.e. those with lower interindividual distance scores) were generally less aggressive towards prey and predators, and were less active. Furthermore, we provide evidence from a parent/offspring breeding study for an additive genetic component to male social tendency (heritability = 0.32). To determine the influence of the male syndrome on mating success, we performed staged male-male contests between social and asocial males for access to females. We found that male social tendency was the single best predictor of success in these trials, with asocial males outperforming social. This finding is opposite to the trend observed in female A. studiosus, where social females experience higher mating success. We propose that the diametrically opposed mating outcomes between the sexes could generate evolutionary conflict.},

Once the potential pilferers have left, they move caches those birds have seen, re-hiding them in new places. Naive birds that had no thieving experience do not do so. By focusing on the counter strategies of the cacher when previously observed by a potential pilferer, these results raise the intriguing possibility that re-caching is based on a form of mental attribution, namely the simulation of another bird's viewpoint.

	abstract = {Men exhibit a stronger tendency to favor the in-group over the out-group compared to women. We examined whether this male-specific "coalitional psychology" represents in-group love or out-group hate. One hundred thirty-three college freshmen played a prisoner's dilemma game with a member of their own group and a member of another group. Both groups consisted of same-sex participants. An in-group bias (cooperation with the in-group at a level higher than cooperation with the out-group) based on expectations of cooperation from the in-group was observed for both men and women. When such expectations were experimentally eliminated, women did not show any in-group bias, whereas men still exhibited an in-group bias. This male-specific in-group bias was found to be a product of intragroup cooperation (in-group love) rather than a product of intergroup competition (out-group hate). These findings suggest that the male-specific coalitional psychology caters more toward the promotion of within-group solidarity than aggression against the out-group.},

Individuals are well informed about the previous actions and reputations, and follow second order norms. Individuals are norm-followers, and imitate their successful group mates. In contrast to previous models where norms classify actions deterministically, we assume that norms determine only the probabilities of actions, and mutants can differ in these probabilities. The central question is how a selective cooperative norm can emerge in a population where initially only non-cooperative norms were present. It is shown that evolution leads to a cooperative state if generous cooperative strategies are dominant, although the "always defecting" and the "always cooperating"-like strategies remain stably present. The characteristics of these generous cooperative strategies and the presence of always defecting and always cooperating strategies are in concordance with experimental observations.},

	abstract = {Conflicts over food, access to mates, or other limited resources can sometimes escalate into aggression. In species that form social groups, these aggressive conflicts can jeopardize the benefits of group living, such as enhanced access to valued resources, necessitating the development of behavioural mechanisms that either mitigate conflicts, prevent aggressive escalation or resolve disputes. Two important mechanisms for managing the effects of disputes involve postconflict (PC) affiliative behaviour, either between the former opponents (called 'reconciliation') or between one opponent and a third party. Even though numerous studies have tested reconciliatory and third-party affiliation tendencies in primates, for non-primate animals little systematic data are available. We performed behavioural observations on three groups of captive domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and used a PC/MC method to test the existence of reconciliation and third-party affiliation in this species. The results of this study clearly indicate that both reconciliation and third-party PC interactions are present in the domestic dog, and form important social mechanisms of the domestic dog. Furthermore, familiar individuals showed a significantly higher proportion of reconciled conflicts than did unfamiliar individuals, and also displayed fewer conflicts. Finally, we show that most of the third-party affiliations involve the victim of a conflict and that victim-directed affiliation outweighs victim-initiated third-party affiliation in these PC interactions.},

	abstract = {Despite prolonged interest in comparing brain size and behavioral proxies of intelligence across taxa, the adaptive and cognitive significance of brain size variation remains elusive. Central to this problem is the continued focus on hominid cognition as a benchmark, and the assumption that behavioral complexity has a simple relationship with brain size. Although comparative studies of brain size have been criticized for not reflecting how evolution actually operates, and for producing spurious, inconsistent results, the causes of these limitations have received little discussion. We show how these issues arise from implicit assumptions about what brain size measures and how it correlates with behavioral and cognitive traits. We explore how inconsistencies can arise through heterogeneity in evolutionary trajectories and selection pressures on neuroanatomy or neurophysiology across taxa. We examine how interference from ecological and life history variables complicates interpretations of brain-behavior correlations, and point out how this problem is exacerbated by the limitations of brain and cognitive measures. These considerations, and the diversity of brain morphologies and behavioral capacities, suggest that comparative brain-behavior research can make greater progress by focusing on specific neuroanatomical and behavioral traits within relevant ecological and evolutionary contexts. We suggest that a synergistic combination of the bottom up approach of classical neuroethology and the top down approach of comparative biology/psychology within closely related but behaviorally diverse clades can limit the effects of heterogeneity, interference, and noise. We argue this shift away from broad-scale analyses of superficial phenotypes will provide deeper, more robust insights into brain evolution.},

These may contribute to insulin resistance and behaviour disorders in their offspring that include attention and learning deficits, generalized anxiety and depression. The changes in behaviour, with or independent of alterations in the function of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, can be induced by prenatal stress in laboratory rodents and non-human primates. The appearance of such changes depends on the timing of the maternal stress, its intensity and duration, gender of the offspring and is associated with structural changes in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. The dysregulation of the HPA axis and behaviour changes can be prevented by maternal adrenalectomy. However, only the increased anxiety and alterations in HPA axis are re-instated by maternal injection of corticosterone. Conclusion: Excess circulating maternal stress hormones alter the programming of foetal neurons, and together with genetic factors, the postnatal environment and quality of maternal attention, determine the behaviour of the offspring.

	abstract = {Animals often make choices based on cues that provide uncertain information about the value of alternative options. To examine how this uncertainty affects sampling behaviour, western scrub-jays were studied in the field during selection of single food items to scatter-hoard. Nine habituated birds were videotaped at feeders during repeated presentations of pairs of unshelled peanuts that varied in size. Jays initially scanned the peanuts before picking one up and in 38\% of trials handled both, often switching repeatedly between them before making a choice. The jays preferred heavier nuts, which contained a larger food reward, but made errors particularly when mass differences were small. In addition, when choosing which nut to pick up first the birds discriminated mass relatively less accurately when the peanuts were larger. When mass differences were small the birds were more likely to handle both nuts before choosing. Handling both nuts raised the probability of selecting the heavier one by 20\%, but did not increase the rate of food acquisition above that obtainable by scanning because it also increased time spent choosing. These results confirm recent suggestions that animals facing difficult discriminations may increase the accuracy of choice by sampling additional cues.},

Physical training is one of the many proposed hypotheses, suggesting that males and females should play differently, that increased maternal investment should lead to increases in play, and that increases in play should result in physical advantages. In a population of feral horses, Equus caballus, males and females did not differ in their play behaviour except that males initiated more of their play bouts than females. Maternal condition influenced play behaviour only in males, with sons of mothers in good condition playing more. However, when we controlled for maternal effects by comparing a son and a daughter of the same mother, daughters played more when their mother was in poor condition and sons played more when their mother was in good condition. Mothers of foals that played more lost more condition. Therefore, the difference in play behaviour could not be explained by offspring sex or maternal condition alone, but play behaviour mirrored variation in maternal investment. In addition, those individuals that played more survived better and had better body condition as yearlings despite weaning earlier. Since increased activity has been linked to enhanced musculoskeletal development in domestic horses, we suggest that play provides a link between increased maternal investment, increased body condition and future reproductive success in feral horses, and probably in other species.},

Setting up a social hierarchy is one way to reduce the costs of conflicts, but the position in the hierarchy has implications for individuals, for instance their susceptibility to conflict and interference, hence to social stress. We investigated relationships between linear social dominance and corticosterone levels, baseline levels and induced-stress response, in captive male mallards Anas platyrhynchos and pintails Anas acuta during the winter period. We hypothesised that corticosterone responses would reflect the costs associated with social stress. From previous work on dominance and corticosterone in wintering birds, we expected that, where the social hierarchy is linear, there would be (1) no relationship between social ranks and baseline corticosterone levels and (2) a significant positive relationship between dominance ranks and responses to acute stress. Our results demonstrated the existence of a linear hierarchy in both species (h' = 0.95 for mallards and h' = 0.97 for pintails), and we found that pintails had on average more corticosterone than mallards. The relationship between dominance and corticosterone responses followed the predictions, with no differences for baseline levels and an attenuated response to induced-stress for subordinates. We discuss these results in the perspective of the cost-benefits of dominance and wintering strategies of waterbirds.},

However, previous studies have reported that hand-reared wolves, C. lupus, fail to locate hidden food in response to similar points in the absence of extensive training. The failure of wolves to perform this task has led to the proposal that the ability to understand others' intentions is a derived character in dogs, not present in the ancestral population (wolves). Here we show that wolves, given the right rearing environment and daily interaction with humans, can use momentary distal human pointing cues to find food without training, whereas dogs tested outdoors and dogs at an animal shelter do not follow the same human points. In line with past studies, pet dogs tested indoors were successful in following these points. We also show that the reported failure of wolves in some past studies may be due to differences in the testing environment. Our findings indicate that domestication is not a prerequisite for human-like social cognition in canids, and show the need for additional research on the role of rearing conditions and environmental factors in the development of higher-level cognitive abilities.},

	abstract = {Mixed-species associations are temporary associations between individuals of different species that are often observed in birds, primates and cetaceans. They have been interpreted as a strategy to reduce predation risk, enhance foraging success and/or provide a social advantage. In the archipelago of the Azores, four species of dolphins are commonly involved in mixed-species associations: the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, and the spotted dolphin, Stenella frontalis. In order to understand the reasons why dolphins associate, we analysed field data collected since 1999 by research scientists and trained observers placed onboard fishing vessels. In total, 113 mixed-species groups were observed out of 5720 sightings. The temporal distribution, habitat (water depth, distance to the coast), behaviour (i.e. feeding, travelling, socializing), size and composition of mixed-species groups were compared with those of single-species groups. Results did not support the predation avoidance hypothesis and gave little support to the social advantage hypothesis. The foraging advantage hypothesis was the most convincing. However, the benefits of mixed-species associations appeared to depend on the species. Associations were likely to be opportunistic in the larger bottlenose dolphin, while there seemed to be some evolutionary constraints favouring associations in the rarer striped dolphin. Comparison with previous studies suggests that the formation of mixed-species groups depends on several environmental factors, and therefore may constitute an adaptive response.},

	abstract = {1Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602 The ability to reflect on one's own mental processes, termed metacognition, is a defining feature of human existence [1] and [2]. Consequently, a fundamental question in comparative cognition is whether nonhuman animals have knowledge of their own cognitive states [3]. Recent evidence suggests that people and nonhuman primates [4], [5], [6], [7] and [8] but not less “cognitively sophisticated” species [3], [9] and [10] are capable of metacognition. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that rats are capable of metacognition—i.e., they know when they do not know the answer in a duration-discrimination test. Before taking the duration test, rats were given the opportunity to decline the test. On other trials, they were not given the option to decline the test. Accurate performance on the duration test yielded a large reward, whereas inaccurate performance resulted in no reward. Declining a test yielded a small but guaranteed reward. If rats possess knowledge regarding whether they know the answer to the test, they would be expected to decline most frequently on difficult tests and show lowest accuracy on difficult tests that cannot be declined [4]. Our data provide evidence for both predictions and suggest that a nonprimate has knowledge of its own cognitive state. Author Keywords: SYSNEURO   One approach used for studying metacognition in nonhumans [4] is giving the animal an option to decline to take a test. Presumably, an animal that knows that it does not know the answer to a test question will decline to take the test. Moreover, being forced to take a test is likely to degrade performance because forced tests include trials that would have been declined had that option been available. Although considerable evidence supports the existence of metacognition in primates, a paucity of research has been conducted with other mammalian species. Developing a rodent model of metacognition may allow for new opportunities to explore its underlying neural mechanisms. To this end, we adapted Hampton's [4] experimental design with monkeys for an experiment with rats. Each trial consisted of three phases: study, choice, and test phases (Figure 1). In the study phase, a brief noise was presented for the subject to classify as short (2–3.62 s) or long (4.42–8 s). Stimuli with intermediate durations (e.g., 3.62 and 4.42 s) are most difficult to classify as short or long [11] and [12]. By contrast, more widely spaced intervals (e.g., 2 and 8 s) are easiest to classify. In the choice phase, the rat was sometimes presented with two response options, signaled by the illumination of two nose-poke apertures. On these choice-test trials, a response in one of these apertures (referred to as a take-the-test response) led to the insertion of two response levers in the subsequent test phase; one lever was designated as the correct response after a short noise, and the other lever was designated as the correct response after a long noise. The other aperture (referred to as the decline-the-test response) led to the omission of the duration test. On other trials in the choice phase, the rat was presented with only one response option; on these forced-test trials, the rat was required to select the aperture that led to the duration test (i.e., the option to decline the test was not available), and this was followed by the duration test. In the test phase, a correct lever press with respect to the duration discrimination produced a large reward of six pellets; an incorrect lever press produced no reward. A decline response (provided that this option was, indeed, available) led to a guaranteed but smaller reward of three pellets. The rate of declining to take the test increased as the difficulty of the discrimination increased (Figures 2A–2D; see also Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). This observation was confirmed for the mean of the rats (F[3,6] = 17.6, p {\textless} 0.01, Figure 2D) and for each rat separately (p {\textless} 0.01, 0.05, and 0.01 for Figures 2A–2C, respectively). The horizontal axis in Figure 2 represents an index of stimulus difficulty (see Data Analysis section below for details). For example, the leftmost point in each panel corresponds to performance after the study item was 2 or 8 s, and such an item was the easiest stimulus to discriminate. By contrast, the rightmost point in each panel corresponds to the most difficult durations to discriminate (3.62 and 4.42 s). Accuracy declined as the difficulty of the discrimination increased, but this decline was greater when the rats were forced to take the test compared to trials on which the rats chose to take the test (Figures 2E–2H). This observation was confirmed by an interaction of trial type and stimulus difficulty for the mean of the rats (F[3,6] = 20.3, p {\textless} 0.01, Figure 2H) and for each rat separately (p {\textless} 0.05, 0.01, and 0.05 for Figures 2E–2G, respectively). No difference between choice- and forced-test accuracy is expected for easy discriminations because there is little room for improvement. However, for the most difficult discrimination (rightmost data in Figures 2E–2H; 3.62 and 4.42 s stimuli), each rat showed higher accuracy on trials in which it had chosen to take the test. The present experiment suggests that rats know when they do not know the answer to a duration-discrimination test. The duration discrimination involved classifying brief noises as short or long. Consequently, durations near the middle of the range are more difficult to classify. The rats were more likely to decline these difficult tests, as would be expected if the rats knew that they did not know the correct duration-discrimination response. Moreover, when we compared accuracy on the duration test, the rats were more accurate when they had chosen to take the duration test compared to trials in which they were forced to take the test. This pattern is predicted by the metacognition hypothesis because forced-test performance includes trials that would have been declined had the option to do so been available. Knowledge about temporal information may play a central role in the organization of behavior [13], and consequently, detailed knowledge about when events occur [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] and [20] may have contributed to our experimental evidence for metacognition. An important feature of the design of this study is that we evaluated accuracy on trials in which the rats were forced to take the test. Moreover, the rats initiated these forced tests in the same manner as they initiated choice tests (i.e., with a nose-poke response). These factors limit the ability of alternative hypotheses to explain our data. For example, the forced duration tests are unlikely to have been unexpected and thereby unlikely to have disrupted accuracy. If forced choices had been surprising, we would expect longer latencies to respond in forced tests relative to choice tests. However, there was no evidence for a difference in the latency to respond with either a nose-poke (t[2] = 1.1, p {\textgreater} 0.05; mean ± SEM: 0.61 ± 0.19 s and 0.80 ± 0.12 s for choice and forced tests, respectively) or lever-press response (t[2] = 0.4, p {\textgreater} 0.05; mean ± SEM: 2.70 ± 0.47 s and 2.65 ± 0.28 s for choice and forced tests, respectively). Consequently, the accuracy difference on forced and choice tests was not likely to be due to performance disruption from unexpected forced tests. Similarly, discrimination of a purely behavioral state (e.g., physical proximity to the response levers), in contrast to discrimination of a cognitive state, is unlikely to fully account for our data. Discrimination of a purely behavioral state predicts equivalent performance on forced and choice tests, and this prediction is not supported by our data (Figures 2E–2H). Although our data do not preclude the possibility that the discrimination of behavioral states contributes to the use of the decline response, such a contribution could be empirically tested in future experiments by collecting of video recordings of the rats' behavior during stimulus presentation. It is also unlikely that learning a contingency between reinforcement rate and specific stimulus durations could account for our data. First, the observed difference in accuracy between choice and forced tests is not predicted by differential reinforcement associated with specific stimulus durations. Second, for a learned contingency to contribute to the observed increase in the decline rate, one must presuppose that rats would prefer guaranteed small rewards more than uncertain large rewards (i.e., that rats are risk averse). However, there is evidence that rats are risk prone in a situation similar to our own [21]. Ultimately, it is important to experimentally dissociate stimulus identity and difficulty by evaluation of the ability of rats to generalize the use of the decline response to a different discrimination, an ability that has recently been reported with monkeys [7] and [8]. As Hampton [4] has argued, although observing putative subjective experiences that may accompany metacognition is not possible, progress in the study of evolution of the human mind and in evaluating the validity of animal models of human cognition will come from documenting objective functional features of human conscious cognition. To this end, we have documented the ability of rats to make adaptive decisions about future behavior contingent on the current availability of knowledge. Developing a rodent model of metacognition may promote new opportunities for exploring the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, neurophysiological, and molecular mechanisms of metacognition. Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Madison, WI; 249 g, 85 days old) were individually housed in a room with a reversed light cycle (light offset at 07:00, onset at 19:00). The rats consumed 45 mg pellets (PJAI-0045, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) during testing sessions and a ration of 5001-Rodent-Diet (Lab Diet, Brentwood, MO), which was adjusted so that total daily intake was 15–20 g. Water was continuously available. All procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and followed guidelines of the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Five rats rarely declined to take the duration test (M = 97.8\%, SEM = ±0.01\%). The performance for these five rats was likely to be a result of response bias because it appeared that these rats failed to learn the experimental contingency of the nose-poke apertures. As a result, these five rats did not provide evidence for or against metacognition. The rats had participated in a pilot study, in which they received a similar training regimen to that described below, during which the reward sizes and intertrial interval were adjusted. All subjects (n = 3) that learned the experimental contingency are included in the data analysis. Identical operant chambers (described in [22]), each located in a ventilated sound-attenuation cubicle, contained a recessed food trough (equipped with a photobeam used for detecting head entries) was centered between two levers on one wall of the chamber. A 45 mg pellet dispenser was positioned outside the chamber and attached to the food trough. A water bottle was placed outside of the chamber with the tube inserted across from the food trough. This wall also contained nose-poke apertures on the left and right sides of the sipper tube. Small white lights were recessed at the back of each nose-poke aperture. Each nose-poke contained a photobeam that detected the entry of the rat's snout. The chamber floor was constructed from 19 stainless steel rods. Other equipment in each chamber included a speaker, clicker, lights, and additional photobeams. Lever-press and nose-poke responses were recorded (10 ms resolution) with MED-PC software (version 4.1) on a computer in a nearby room. Rats were given one pellet per min accompanied by a click for 30 min per day on the first pretraining session. On subsequent pretraining sessions, the left lever was inserted, and each food pellet was delivered contingent on a single lever press until ten pellets had been earned. Next, the left lever was retracted and the right lever was inserted until ten additional pellets had been earned. The lever training session continued, in this manner, until 60 min had passed or 60 pellets had been earned. Rats were initially trained to discriminate short and long durations. A trial consisted of presentation of a white noise (70 dB) for a randomly and independently selected duration (2.00, 2.44, 2.97, 3.62, 4.42, 5.38, 6.56, and 8.00 s; equally spaced on a logarithmic scale), an insertion of two response levers, the rat's lever press, feedback, and retraction of the levers, and this was followed by an intertrial interval of 45 s. The first four durations (i.e., values less than 4 s, designated as short durations) were rewarded for pressing one lever (e.g., left), and the other four durations (values greater than 4 s, designated as long) were rewarded for pressing the other lever (e.g., right) as described elsewhere [23] and [24]; the assignment of left and right levers was counterbalanced across rats prior to the start of the experiment. Each session lasted 2 hr, 5 days per week, for 35 sessions. Rats were trained for three daily sessions to break the photobeam in the nose-poke apertures. At the beginning of each session, the left nose-poke light was illuminated and the rat was required to break the photobeam in the left nose-poke aperture to earn a reward. After the rat had broken the left nose-poke photobeam, the light in the left nose poke aperture was turned off and a pellet and a click were delivered. This process continued for ten pellets on the left nose-poke aperture and was followed by a switch to the right nose-poke aperture for the next ten pellets. The nose-poke trials continued, in this manner, until 60 min had elapsed or 60 pellets had been earned. A noise was presented, as described above in Duration-Discrimination Training. In the choice phase, two nose-poke apertures were illuminated in two-thirds of the trials (see Figure 1, right). Breaking the photobeam inside one of the nose-poke apertures (designated as the take-the-test nose-poke response) caused the lights to be extinguished, the levers to be inserted, and a duration test to be initiated as described above. Breaking the photobeam inside the other nose-poke aperture (designated as the decline-the-test nose-poke response) caused the lights to be extinguished but did not produce insertion of the levers. Instead, the rat was required to break a photobeam inside the food trough to obtain food and terminate the trial. The assignment of left and right nose-poke apertures to take and decline responses was counterbalanced across rats before the experiment began. In the remaining one-third of trials, only the take-the-test nose-poke aperture was illuminated (see Figure 1, left); a response in the illuminated nose-poke aperture was required for insertion of the levers and initiation of a duration test, as described above. By contrast, a response in the other (i.e., dark) nose-poke aperture did not advance the rat to the next phase of the trial. Choice and forced tests were randomly intermixed throughout the session. The reward size was six or zero pellets after a correct or incorrect duration-discrimination lever press, respectively. If the rat declined the duration test, the reward size was three pellets. The intertrial interval was 8 min, and each session lasted 9 hr, for 22–26 sessions (1546 trials, on average). The long intertrial interval may have reduced confusion between individual trials and enhanced the salience of the auditory stimulus. Stimulus durations were equally spaced on a logarithmic scale for ensuring that pairs of durations were equated for difficulty. When rats are trained to discriminate 2 and 8 s, the point of subjective equality (i.e., the stimulus duration at which the probability of judging the stimulus as short or long are equal) occurs at 4 s [11] and [12], which is the geometric mean of 2 and 8 s (i.e., the midpoint on a logarithmic scale). Note that the absolute difference between two and four and between four and eight are equal on a logarithmic scale; therefore, a point of subjective equality at 4 s means that 2 and 8 s are equated for stimulus difficulty [11] and [12]. Similarly, the second and seventh stimuli (2.44 and 6.56 s) are equally spaced on a log scale with respect to 4 s, as are the third and sixth (2.97 and 5.38 s) stimuli and the fourth and fifth (3.62 and 4.42 s) stimuli. Consequently, we pooled the data within identical levels of stimulus difficulty to obtain four levels of stimulus difficulty. The index of stimulus difficulty (horizontal axes in Figure 2) was calculated as the absolute log distance of each stimulus duration from the geometric mean of 4 s, expressed in seconds. For example, the most difficult stimuli to discriminate are closely spaced (3.62 and 4.42 s) near the geometric mean (rightmost data in Figure 2; index of stimulus difficulty = 1.1), whereas the easiest stimuli to discriminate are widely spaced (2 and 8 s; leftmost data in Figure 2; index of stimulus difficulty = 2.0). A median latency for each rat was calculated between duration-stimulus termination and the nose-poke response and between nose-poke and lever-press responses for choice- and forced-test trials. Terminal performance (487 trials, on average) was analyzed with repeated measures analyses of variance. A value of p {\textless} 0.05 was considered significant.

	abstract = {Suites of correlated behaviors, or "behavioral syndromes," have been shown to occur throughout the animal kingdom. Behavioral syndromes involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice, and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction. Our analyses also revealed a "fast-slow" syndrome, linking behavior in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context. Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call "libido." Libido was defined by a positive relationship between courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context. Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context, may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior in this population.},

Excessive yawning appears to be symptomatic of conditions that increase brain and/or core temperature, such as central nervous system damage, sleep deprivation and specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Yawning is also associated with drowsiness, and subjective ratings of sleepiness are correlated with increases in body temperature. This view of yawning has widespread application for the basic physiological understanding of thermoregulation as well as for the improved diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with abnormal thermoregulation.

We also used recapture data to establish longevity records of resident species, including Caribbean Elaenia (Elaenia martinica; ≥7 years), Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola; 7 years), Black-faced Grassquit (Tiaris bicolor; ≥9 years), and Zenaida Dove (Zenaida aurita; 5 years).

Few studies have investigated whether the context of a fight affects reconciliation—selective postconflict attraction between former opponents—and consolation: selective attraction between conflict participants and other group members. We studied social conflict and its aftermath in two captive groups of brown capuchins (Cebus apella), an arboreal New World species. We observed postconflict behavior in two contexts: (1) during the presence of highly attractive, clumped food—food condition—and (2) in the absence of such food—nonfood condition. Commercial monkey chow was available ad libitum in the nonfood condition. A comparison of postconflict and control observations revealed a conciliatory tendency in the capuchins, but only following fights that occurred in the absence of highly attractive food. Other group members tended not to seek postconflict contact with former conflict participants. However, when shortly after fights recipients of aggression, but not aggressors, initiated affiliation with third parties, the latter not only allowed proximity or contact but also often reciprocated through grooming, play, and especially the exchange of friendly signals. We discuss these results within the framework of current knowledge of postconflict behavior with special emphasis on similarities and differences in the postconflict behavior of Cebus and Pan.},

Many cases of eavesdropping in birds and mammals involve social species in mixed-species groups, but this is not always true and the reliability of information may also be critical. We used a playback experiment and observations of natural alarm calling to test for understanding of aerial "hawk" alarms among 3 species of passerine and assess call reliability. Superb fairy-wrens and white-browed scrubwrens are ecologically similar and can share mixed-species flocks, whereas New Holland honeyeaters are ecologically distinct and do not flock with the other species. Fairy-wrens and scrubwrens fled to cover to each other's alarm calls, but they also both fled to honeyeater alarms. Honeyeaters fled to scrubwren but usually not fairy-wren alarms. The pattern of heterospecific responses appears related to call reliability from each species' perspective. Honeyeaters called only to predators of all 3 species and so provided reliable information to all. From a honeyeater's perspective, fairy-wrens were least reliable, as they gave 52\% of their calls to nonpredators, whereas scrubwrens gave only 18\% to nonpredators. However, from a scrubwren's perspective, fairy-wrens were largely reliable because most calls to nonpredators were to red wattlebirds, which pose a physical threat to fairy-wrens and scrubwrens but not honeyeaters. We conclude that there can be mutual responses to alarm calls between ecologically distinct species, that responses can be symmetrical or asymmetrical between species, and that call reliability appears to affect response.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that it should often be in the best interests of gregarious animals to repair social bonds damaged by within-group conflict. Indeed, reconciliation in many primates takes the form of affiliative behavior occurring shortly after a conflict. Here we inquired whether reconciliation also occurs among spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), gregarious carnivores whose social lives share much in common with those of cercopithecine primates. In a large group of free-living hyenas in Kenya, we used focal animal observations to monitor rates at which various affiliative behaviors occurred before and after dyadic aggressive interactions. An affiliative behavior was identified as having a conciliatory function only if it occurred more frequently after than before fights, and if it was also associated with reduced rates of aggression between former opponents during the post-conflict interval. Of all affiliative behaviors monitored, only two types satisfied both these criteria: greeting behavior and non-aggressive approach. Over 72\% of conciliatory behaviors occurred within the first five minutes after a fight, and hyenas reconciled after 14.6\% of 698 fights. Mean conciliatory tendency (CT) for individual hyenas was 11.3\%. Hyenas exhibited higher CTs when they were recipients (victims) of aggression than when they were aggressors, and they showed higher CTs in interactions with non-kin than with kin. Conciliatory tendencies did not vary with age2013sex classes of opponents or with rank distance between opponents. Conciliatory tendency in spotted hyenas fell at the low end of the CT range observed among primates.},

Here we used a habituation–dishabituation paradigm to demonstrate that rats can discriminate individual cats by their odor. Rats were repeatedly exposed to a collar previously worn by a domestic cat. Strong initial defensive responses (hiding in a small box and vigilant “head out” behavior from the box entrance) habituated with repeated exposure to the same collar. Brain activation following repeated presentation of the same odor – as indexed by c-Fos expression – also habituated in accessory olfactory regions (mitral and granular layers of the posterior accessory olfactory bulb and posteroventral medial amygdala), as well as regions involved in defensive behavior, including the ventromedial and dorsal premammillary hypothalamic nuclei, basolateral amygdala and periaqueductal grey. When a collar taken from a different cat was presented to habituated rats, defensive responses (hiding, vigilance, suppression of grooming) were dishabituated, and c-Fos expression was reinstated in the accessory olfactory system and in defense-related hypothalamic, amygdaloid and brainstem nuclei. Results indicate that rats may process and store details of the chemosensory signatures of individual predators using the accessory olfactory system.

For example, an individual's behaviour in response to a predator might be related to the same individual's behaviour towards conspecifics. We examined the developmental stability of single behaviours (activity in an unfamiliar environment, aggressive behaviour and boldness under predation risk) and correlations between these behaviours in two Californian populations of three-spined sticklebacks. Individually marked fish were measured for all three behaviours at three points during development, as juveniles, subadults and adults. Even though single behaviours were unstable through time, some correlations between behaviours were stable. For example, in one population, neither boldness nor aggression was stable but the positive correlation between them was. Certain correlations between behaviours were apparent at some developmental stages but not others, and the pattern of correlations differed between the two populations. These data suggest that behavioural syndromes do not necessarily limit behavioural plasticity, and suggest that ecological and developmental circumstances might favour different suites of traits.},

A number of authors have modelled aspects of infanticide and its potential impact on social systems, but limited attention has been paid to identifying the full range of conditions under which infanticide should be favoured or the variety of potential effects that infanticide may have on male mating strategies. While most authors focus on infanticide by new male immigrants, natural selection should favour infanticide under a wider range of conditions, including sometimes by potential fathers. Here we model male decisions about whether to commit infanticide and explore how infanticide risk may affect optimal male mating strategies. Infanticide risk coupled with imperfect infanticide protection in a population creates a fitness landscape with two adaptive peaks, one representing complete paternity certainty and the other representing a compromise between maximizing paternity and minimizing infanticide risk. Which of these adaptive peaks represents the fitness-maximizing global optimum depends on a population's socioecology and characteristics of the male. In many ecological contexts, males may adaptively reduce their paternity probability to reduce the risk of infanticide. Explicit consideration of this possibility may enhance our understanding of the dynamics of mammalian intrasexual and intersexual competition in a number of ways.},

Thus, the anti-depressant-like effects of testosterone (T) and its metabolites are of interest. Given that these androgens have disparate mechanisms of action, it is important to begin to characterize and compare their effects in an aged animal model. We hypothesized that there would be sex differences in depression behavior of aged mice and that androgens would reduce depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test. To investigate this, male and female mice ({\textasciitilde} 24 months old) were subcutaneously administered T, or one of its 5[alpha]-reduced metabolites (dihydrotesterone-DHT, 5[alpha]-androstane,17[beta]-diol-3[alpha]-diol), or aromatized metabolite (estradiol -- E2), or oil vehicle. Mice were administered androgens (1 mg/kg) 1 h before being tested in the forced swim test, an animal model of depression. We found that males spent more time immobile, and less time swimming, than females. Administration of T, DHT, or 3[alpha]-diol similarly reduced time spent immobile, and increased time spent struggling, of male and female mice. E2, compared to vehicle administration, decreased time spent immobile of males and females, but increased time spent swimming of females and time spent struggling of male mice. Together, these data suggest that T and its 5[alpha]-reduced and aromatized metabolites have anti-depressant-like effects in aged male and female mice.},

Setting up a social hierarchy is one way to reduce the costs of conflicts, but the position in the hierarchy has implications for individuals, for instance their susceptibility to conflict and interference, hence to social stress. We investigated relationships between linear social dominance and corticosterone levels, baseline levels and induced-stress response, in captive male mallards Anas platyrhynchos and pintails Anas acuta during the winter period. We hypothesised that corticosterone responses would reflect the costs associated with social stress. From previous work on dominance and corticosterone in wintering birds, we expected that, where the social hierarchy is linear, there would be (1) no relationship between social ranks and baseline corticosterone levels and (2) a significant positive relationship between dominance ranks and responses to acute stress. Our results demonstrated the existence of a linear hierarchy in both species (h' = 0.95 for mallards and h' = 0.97 for pintails), and we found that pintails had on average more corticosterone than mallards. The relationship between dominance and corticosterone responses followed the predictions, with no differences for baseline levels and an attenuated response to induced-stress for subordinates. We discuss these results in the perspective of the cost-benefits of dominance and wintering strategies of waterbirds.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that it should often be in the best interests of gregarious animals to repair social bonds damaged by within-group conflict. Indeed, reconciliation in many primates takes the form of affiliative behavior occurring shortly after a conflict. Here we inquired whether reconciliation also occurs among spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), gregarious carnivores whose social lives share much in common with those of cercopithecine primates. In a large group of free-living hyenas in Kenya, we used focal animal observations to monitor rates at which various affiliative behaviors occurred before and after dyadic aggressive interactions. An affiliative behavior was identified as having a conciliatory function only if it occurred more frequently after than before fights, and if it was also associated with reduced rates of aggression between former opponents during the post-conflict interval. Of all affiliative behaviors monitored, only two types satisfied both these criteria: greeting behavior and non-aggressive approach. Over 72\% of conciliatory behaviors occurred within the first five minutes after a fight, and hyenas reconciled after 14.6\% of 698 fights. Mean conciliatory tendency (CT) for individual hyenas was 11.3\%. Hyenas exhibited higher CTs when they were recipients (victims) of aggression than when they were aggressors, and they showed higher CTs in interactions with non-kin than with kin. Conciliatory tendencies did not vary with age2013sex classes of opponents or with rank distance between opponents. Conciliatory tendency in spotted hyenas fell at the low end of the CT range observed among primates.},

To test whether species with the highest metabolic rates also lived the longest I determined the relationship between relative longevity (maximum lifespan), after adjusting for annual adult survival rate, body mass and sampling effort, and mass-specific field metabolic rate (FMR) in 35 species of birds. There was a strongly positive relationship between relative longevity and FMR, consistent with the hypothesis. This conclusion was robust to statistical control for effects of potentially confounding variables such as age at first reproduction, latitude and migration distance, and similarity in phenotype among species because of common phylogenetic descent. Therefore, species of birds with high metabolic rates senesce more slowly than species with low metabolic rates.},

	abstract = {Stumptailed macaques, Macaca arctoides, are characterized by high levels of postconflict affiliative contacts between opponents. We investigated the occurrence of postconflict affiliative contacts between opponents and third parties that were not involved in the original conflict. We collected 10-min focal observations during postconflict and control periods in which we recorded all aggressive and affiliative behaviours between opponents and third parties. We distinguished three types of third parties depending on the relationship with the focal animal: own kin, opponent's kin and individuals unrelated to both opponents. We analysed the interactions with third parties separately, while distinguishing two classes of affiliative behaviours: (1) allogrooming and contact sitting and (2) sociosexual behaviours (e.g. genital inspection). The macaques showed differences between postconflict and control periods in their affiliative contacts with third parties. Aggressors received more postconflict grooming and contact sitting from their opponents' kin, received more sociosexual behaviour from their own kin and unrelated individuals, and directed more sociosexual behaviour to unrelated individuals. Victims received and directed less postconflict grooming from and towards their own kin. They received more postconflict sociosexual behaviour from all partners except their own kin and directed more sociosexual behaviour to all partners except the opponent's kin. This study establishes the occurrence of multiple postconflict triadic affiliation in stumptailed macaques, and is the first to show that victims receive contacts from third parties in a cercopithecine species, a behaviour previously described only in chimpanzees. It also highlights the importance of analysing the different affiliative behaviours separately in postconflict situations. Otherwise, many of the patterns we report, especially those involving victims, would have been missed.},

Moreover, long-term social dynamics provide an avenue for understanding population-level responses to changes in socioecological conditions. This is particularly true for species that show natal philopatry and highly stable hierarchically structured social units, such as the piscivorous resident killer whales of the northeast Pacific. The southern resident killer whale population is a small, demographically closed population, comprising three commonly recognized pods (J, K and L pods), that has recently been listed as endangered throughout its range in both Canadian and U.S.A. waters. In this study, we quantitatively assessed social structure in this population from 29 years of photo-identification data to characterize significant temporal changes in sociality. Preferential affiliation among killer whales within both genealogical matrilines and pods was supported by two different analytical methods and, despite interannual variability, these social clusters persisted throughout the study. All three pods experienced fluctuations in social cohesion over time, but the overall rate of intrapod affiliation was consistently lowest within L pod, the largest of the southern resident pods. The most recent increase in fluidity within social units, occurring in the mid to late 1990s, was coincident with a significant decline in population size, suggesting a possible common response to external stressors. Quantifying these trends in social structure is the first step towards understanding the causes and consequences of long-term changes in killer whale social structure.},

However, nest sites are a limited resource, non-breeding adults are also common around colonies and males are frequently separated from their incubating females during the fertile egg-laying period so that opportunities arise for extra-pair copulation. The parentage analysis, however, revealed no cases of extra-pair fertilisation (EPF) or intra-specific brood parasitism. Therefore fledgling output or survival is likely to be a good measure of individual reproductive success in this species. The lack of EPFs is not explained by nesting synchrony and we discuss the relative costs and benefits to females of seeking EPFs; the likelihood that paternal care and a life-history strategy similar to many long-lived non-passerines may also constrain the species to monogamy.},

Here I use data collected over 10 years on a community of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, to investigate whether male chimpanzees establish long-term social relationships and to determine the factors that affect variation in relationship quality and the stability of social bonds. Kinship and dominance rank influenced the quality of relationships. Maternal brothers and males of the same dominance rank class groomed each other more equitably than did unrelated males and males that were dissimilar in rank. In addition, males that formed strong social bonds groomed more equitably than did males that displayed weaker bonds. Social bonds were stable over time, with relationships in one year predicting those in subsequent years. Kinship and the quality of social relationships affected bond stability. Maternal half siblings and males that groomed each other equitably maintained longer-lasting bonds than did nonkin and males that groomed each other unevenly. Virtually all of the males established at least one enduring relationship with another individual. The most enduring bonds formed between a few pairs of maternal brothers and dyads that maintained balanced grooming interactions. These results indicate that male chimpanzees maintain long-lasting and equitable social bonds whose formation is affected by maternal kinship and the quality of social relationships.},

	abstract = {Can suffering in non-human animals be studied scientifically? Apart from verbal reports of subjective feelings, which are uniquely human, I argue that it is possible to study the negative emotions we refer to as suffering by the same methods we use in ourselves. In particular, by asking animals what they find positively and negatively reinforcing (what they want and do not want), we can define positive and negative emotional states. Such emotional states may or may not be accompanied by subjective feelings but fortunately it is not necessary to solve the problem of consciousness to construct a scientific study of suffering and welfare. Improvements in animal welfare can be based on the answers to two questions: Q1: Will it improve animal health? and Q2: Will it give the animals something they want? This apparently simple formulation has the advantage of capturing what most people mean by 'improving welfare' and so halting a potentially dangerous split between scientific and non-scientific definitions of welfare. It can also be used to validate other controversial approaches to welfare such as naturalness, stereotypies, physiological and biochemical measures. Health and what animals want are thus not just two of many measures of welfare. They provide the definition of welfare against which others can be validated. They also tell us what research we have to do and how we can judge whether welfare of animals has been genuinely improved. What is important, however, is for this research to be done in situ so that it is directly applicable to the real world of farming, the sea or an animal's wild habitat. It is here that ethology can make major contributions.},

	abstract = {In various social species, animals have been observed to share friendly relationships with some group members and to resolve conflicts through reconciliation, the exchange of affiliative behaviour soon after a conflict that functions to restore the relationship between the former opponents. The valuable relationship hypothesis predicts that reconciliation should be observed more often after conflicts between friends. Friendly relationships can be described by three dimensions (i.e. value, security and compatibility); however, research into the relative importance of these dimensions for the occurrence of reconciliation is sparse. Moreover, reconciliation may depend on factors other than the social relationship between opponents including, for example, their social status or the context of the conflict. Our study aimed at analysing which factors are important determinants of reconciliation and at testing the valuable relationship hypothesis, by analysing the relative effects of relationship value, security and compatibility on the occurrence and timing of reconciliation. We collected data on two troops of wild Japanese macaques living on Yakushima Island, Japan, and selected the best predicting variables of reconciliation using linear mixed models. Our results show that reconciliation occurs more frequently, and earlier, after conflicts between opponents who exchange a higher percentage of grooming. Two additional variables related to relationship security and value were selected in the best models: frequency of aggression and of approaches resulting in tolerated co-feeding. Among the variables not related to relationship quality, distance between opponents at the end of the conflict, kinship, sex of the opponents and context of conflict (i.e. during feeding or social time) were included in our models. Our findings support the valuable relationship hypothesis and, in particular, highlight that the fitness-related benefits of social relationships (i.e. the relationship value) are important determinants of the evolution of friendly relationships and reconciliation.},

	abstract = {Monogamy is a relatively rare social system in mammals, occurring only in about 3\% of mammalian species. Monogamous species are characterized by the formation of pair-bonds, biparental care, and a very low level of sexual dimorphism. Whereas in most polygynous species males engage in more rough-and-tumble play than females, we predicted that males and females of monogamous species would have similar, or monomorphic, play behavior. In this study, we focused on two monogamous species: coppery titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). We documented the development of play behavior in both species, and quantified different types of play behavior. We did not find any sex differences in either species in the frequencies and types of play. However, we did find sex differences in the choice of play partner in titi monkeys: female offspring spent a higher proportion of time playing with their father, while male offspring played equally with their mother and father. It is possible that rough-and-tumble play behavior is monomorphic in many monogamous mammals, perhaps reflecting differences from polygynous species in the effects of exposure to early androgens or in the estrogen receptor distribution. However, more subtle differences in monomorphic play behavior, such as choice of partner, may still exist.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that populations and species often exhibit behavioral syndromes; that is, suites of correlated behaviors across situations. An example is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive across a range of situations and contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield numerous new insights.},

In this study, we examined the time frame of partner choice in the reciprocal grooming of captive female tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella). Female capuchins groomed preferentially those individuals that overall groomed them most. Tufted capuchins did sometimes reciprocate grooming immediately. We quantified the time course and probability of immediate reciprocation, and excluded from the analysis cases of immediate reciprocation. We then showed that, even excluding immediate reciprocation, female capuchins still preferred to groom those individuals that groom them most. Our results show that partner choice is not necessarily based on immediate reciprocation and suggest that capuchins are able to reciprocate over longer time frames. These findings argue against the hypothesis that long-term reciprocation is absent in species lacking sophisticated cognitive abilities. We suggest that reciprocal altruism over long time frames relies on a system of emotional bookkeeping.},

Although fights are generally dyadic level encounters, they are on occasion disrupted by the intervention of third-party males. We investigated these third-party interventions using predictions derived from Dugatkin's model (Dugatkin 1998, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 265, 433-437) of intervention behaviour. The model argues that when an individual successfully defeats an opponent there is an increase in the probability of winning a subsequent contest: a winner effect. Third-party intervention behaviour is predicted to occur as it serves to prevent either member of a competing dyad from successfully defeating his opponent, achieving a winner effect and subsequently becoming a threat to the intervener. Consistent with model predictions, our results show that intervening males held significantly higher rank than males that did not intervene and were also more likely to be dominant to both of the competing males. Intervening males did not selectively target competitors based on rank, nor did they target males based on overall dyadic rates of aggression between the intervener and competing males. Furthermore, interveners were more likely to have won their interaction immediately prior to intervention and were also likely to win their interaction subsequent to intervention when compared with contest success of the two competing males. Our results are consistent with predictions that support a winner effect for intervention behaviour in fallow deer fights.},

be important for the species. Using 9 yr of data and {\textgreater}22,300 h of observation of adult female orangutans in Gunung Palung
National Park in Indonesian Borneo, we examined both forms of competition. Based on our analyses, we have 4 conclusions: 1)
Adult female orangutans have highly overlapping home ranges, and thus there is potential for scramble competition to impose
a cost. 2) Adult female orangutans actively avoid each other, suggesting that scramble competition indeed imposes a cost.
3) Adult females have distinct core areas that overlap to a lesser degree than home ranges do. 4) Analyses of contest competition
reveal a slight spatial component to female competition for the first time. Preliminary evidence for core area defense and
passive range exclusion may be among the mechanisms responsible for maintaining distinct adult female core areas.},

	abstract = {The formation of animal societies is a major transition in evolution. It is challenging to understand why societies are stable, given the reproductive conflicts inherent within them. Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for how and why reproductive conflicts are resolved. Indeed, some have suggested that skew theory represents a general theory of social evolution. Lamentably, skew theory is composed of many independent models, with the generality of each model being restricted by its assumptions. Here, we tackle this problem, using Hamilton's rule to predict the conditions under which assumptions of major classes of skew models (transactional and tug-of-war) apply. First, building on transactional models, we define the amount of reproduction that individuals can negotiate based on the threat of group dissolution (the "outside option") and determine conditions under which groups will be stable (free of group dissolution). Second, building on tug-of-war models, we define the amount of reproduction that individuals can negotiate based on the threat of costly competition (the "inside option") and determine conditions under which groups will be tranquil (free of costly competition). Finally, synthesizing transactional and tug-of-war approaches, we determine the conditions under which individuals will negotiate based on outside rather than inside options. Simply, individuals will negotiate using their outside option when it is greater than their inside option and vice versa. We conduct a post hoc test of all predictions in one simple animal society - the clown anemonefish, Amphiprion percula. The product is a more general and demonstrably testable model of reproductive skew, which should help to refocus the debate surrounding the utility of reproductive skew theory as a general theory of social evolution.},

Much is known about vocal social communication through auditory playback techniques; however, visual information may also be important for conspecific recognition in the absence of auditory cues. Within the visual channel both static and dynamic features may play important roles in individual recognition. Rooks are a social corvid and they live in large colonies and form long-term pair bonds, both requiring the ability to recognize individuals. In this study we investigated whether rooks ‘see’ a digital image as a representation of a real animal, using visual playback techniques and a new paradigm for assessing social preferences that uses stimuli differing in features such as whether they are live animals, static or video images, or stuffed models. We presented the rooks with two different stimuli of the same category and recorded the amount of time they observed each stimulus. Rooks preferred to look at a live bird, static or video image of a bird, and a stuffed model over an empty compartment. Rooks also showed a clear preference for a strongly affiliated conspecific (e.g. their partner) over a nonaffiliated conspecific. This preference was not apparent when we presented subjects with static images; however, the preference was seen with video, indicating that rooks can recognize individuals in video.

Here, we suggest that horizon scanning is an underused tool that should become a standard element of environmental and conservation practice.

The proposed functions for such triadic interactions are numerous, mostly concerning the benefit for the former conflict opponents. We investigated post-conflict third-party affiliation (TPA) in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with the aim of assessing what the affiliating third parties may gain from affiliation. Specifically, we tested whether third-party-initiated affiliation protects the third parties from further aggression by conflict opponents. We found support for this ldquoself-protection hypothesis,rdquo in that third parties selectively directed affiliation to those opponents who more often gave further aggression to them, and affiliation effectively decreased their chance of receiving aggression from these opponents. However, a subset of affiliation, provided to conflict victims by their own kin, appeared to not be self-protective and the function of it remained open. We conclude that chimpanzee third-party-initiated affiliation is a more heterogeneous behavior than thus far assumed. Am. J. Primatol. 71:409-418, 2009. � 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {1Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602 A fundamental question in comparative cognition is whether animals remember unique, personal past experiences 1, 2 and 3. It has long been argued that memories for specific events (referred to as episodic memory) are unique to humans 4 and 5. Recently, considerable evidence has accumulated to show that food-storing birds possess critical behavioral elements of episodic memory 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, referred to as episodic-like memory in acknowledgment of the fact that behavioral criteria do not assess subjective experiences [1]. Here we show that rats have a detailed representation of remembered events and meet behavioral criteria for episodic-like memory. We provided rats with access to locations baited with distinctive (e.g., grape and raspberry) or nondistinctive (regular chow) flavors. Locations with a distinctive flavor replenished after a long but not a short delay, and locations with the nondistinctive flavor never replenished. One distinctive flavor was devalued after encoding its location by prefeeding that flavor (satiation) or by pairing it with lithium chloride (acquired taste aversion 11 and 12), while the other distinctive flavor was not devalued. The rats selectively decreased revisits to the devalued distinctive flavor but not to the nondevalued distinctive flavor. The present studies demonstrate that rats selectively encode the content of episodic-like memories. Author Keywords:SYSNEURO A central feature of human memory is the ability to encode multiple features about previous experiences, in particular, its content (what), location in space (where), and occurrence in time (when) [13]. Scrub jays meet behavioral criteria for episodic-like memory (i.e., flexible deployment of an integrated representation of what-where-when an event occurred) 9 and 10. To further facilitate our understanding of the neural mechanisms mediating episodic memory, it would be useful to validate a framework for studying what-where-when memory in rodents. If rats have specific information about the content of events they experienced in the past, together with knowledge of when and where those events occurred, then they should adjust their behavior to the temporal and spatial constraints of food availability. Moreover, they should flexibly change their behavior if a future outcome is expected to be less desirable than in the past 1, 14 and 15. To address this question, we trained rats to discriminate what, where, and when they encountered food 16 and 17. Each day rats were allowed to retrieve food (grape-, raspberry-, or chow-flavored) pellets on an 8-arm radial maze (Figure 1). After a chow pellet was consumed at an arm, that arm did not provide additional food until the next trial; trials were separated by a day. Rats visited four baited arms (randomly chosen on each trial; study phase; Figure 1A) and were later returned to the maze after either a short or long retention interval, with all eight locations available (test phase; Figures 1B and 1C). The first phase provides an opportunity to study the first four locations; the second phase is a test because chow was always available in the test phase at locations that were not visited in the study phase. To add a what component to the task, two study-phase locations were baited with distinctive flavors: one of the locations was baited with grape and the other was baited with raspberry pellets (randomly selected on each study phase), and these locations replenished grape or raspberry pellets, respectively, in the test phase after a long (6 hr) retention interval (Figure 1C) but not after a short (1 hr) retention interval (when; Figure 1B). Chow-flavored pellets were available at previously inaccessible locations in every test phase but never replenished. If rats remembered when and where they had recently encountered distinctive pellets, then they should learn to selectively revisit the distinctive locations after a long delay but withhold revisits after a short delay. Rats were more likely to revisit grape and raspberry locations after long than after short retention intervals (Figure 2; F(1,11) = 120.6, p {\textless} .01). Revisit probabilities were similar for both flavors (F(1,11) = 4.63, p {\textgreater} .05), and the effect of the retention interval did not depend on the flavor (F(1,11) = 0.10, p {\textgreater} .05). Accuracy in avoiding revisits to depleted chow-flavored locations was .91 ± .02 and .72 ± .02 (mean ± SEM) after short and long retention intervals, respectively, consistent with performance declining as a function of retention interval [18]. If the rats remember the specific flavor at each location, then they should flexibly adjust their behavior according to the expected value of foraging at a particular time and place. Therefore, we decreased the value of one distinctive flavor while leaving the value of the other flavors intact. Each rat was satiated to a distinctive flavor during a long retention interval, with the order of flavors counterbalanced across rats. Figure 3 shows the expected probability of revisiting distinctive locations after a long retention interval (baseline) together with the observed probabilities at locations with devalued and nondevalued distinctive flavors; the probability of a revisit differed across conditions (F(2,22) = 7.47, p {\textless} .01). Planned comparisons revealed that after a distinctive flavor was devalued, the probability of revisiting the corresponding location on the maze was lower than baseline (Figure 3; F(1,22) = 14.88, p {\textless} .01), but the revisit probability to the location containing the nondevalued flavor was not reliably lower than baseline (F(1,22) = 3.21, p {\textgreater} .05). The revisit probability to the devalued location was lower than the revisit probability to the nondevalued location (F(1,22) = 4.27, p = .0508). Revisits to chow-flavored locations did not decline (t(11) = 1.93, p {\textgreater} .05), further demonstrating content specificity of episodic-like memory. Thus, rats selectively reduced their revisits to the devalued, but not the nondevalued, food type. The same conclusion was reached when the grape and raspberry devaluations were examined separately. To provide an independent line of evidence for content specificity of episodic-like memory, we transferred the rats to new distinctive flavors (chocolate and banana) and devalued chocolate by pairing it with lithium chloride. Revisits to the new distinctive flavors were higher after the first long retention interval than after the first short retention interval (t(11) = 3.32, p {\textless} .01), similar to that observed with the initially selected distinctive flavors. Rats were more likely to revisit the chocolate and banana locations after long than after short retention intervals (Figure 4A, F(1,11) = 172.3, p {\textless} .01). Revisit probabilities were similar for both flavors (F(1,11) = 3.37, p {\textgreater} .05), and the effect of the retention interval did not depend on the flavors (F(1,11) = 1.96, p {\textgreater} .05). During a single long retention interval, rats ate chocolate and were later injected with lithium chloride. The rats immediately reduced revisits to the location containing chocolate (Figure 4B, t(11) = −8.98, p {\textless} .01), consistent with the development of an acquired taste aversion to chocolate. By contrast, the rats did not reduce revisits to the location containing the other distinctive food type (banana; t(11) = 1, p {\textgreater} .05). The present experiment demonstrates that rats have a detailed representation of the content of recently experienced events in addition to information about when and where those events occurred. They flexibly adapted their visits in time and space to exploit the availability of desirable foods, while selectively avoiding locations with less desirable foods based on new information about the desirability of one of the food types. In our study, five lines of evidence provide a compelling case that rodents possess what-where-when memory. First, the what component appears to be quite specific. The selective reduction in revisits to the devalued, but not the nondevalued, food type could not have occurred without specific memories of where each food type was located on each trial. Second, because the devaluation occurred after study-phase encoding, the reduction in revisits to devalued food sites cannot be explained by encoding failure. Third, because the effect of each flavor devaluation was assessed with a single postmanipulation test phase, the data were obtained before any learning (e.g., punishment) could occur with respect to the consequences of visiting a location with that devalued flavor. Fourth, a global shift in revisit strategies cannot explain the observed data. Reverting to a win-shift strategy [19] after devaluation predicts that visits to devalued and nondevalued food types would decline to the same extent, a possibility discounted by the present data. Fifth, the decrease in revisits to the devalued location cannot be attributed to learning a new semantic rule because satiation is temporary. By contrast, acquired taste aversion involves new learning that a flavor is bad based upon exposure to gastrointestinal distress. Nevertheless, because two different devaluation paradigms produced similar results, the most parsimonious explanation for the selective decrease in revisits observed after each devaluation manipulation is that rats flexibly adjusted their visits based upon new information about the current desirability of the food types (i.e., the content of episodic-like memories). These features were not present in our previous investigations of episodic-like memory in rats 16 and 17. Rats preferentially revisited the locations with distinctive food at times when these locations were scheduled to replenish, suggesting that they encoded a when component of episodic-like memory. Recently, we have shown that the discrimination of what-where-when is not based on time of day [17]. Consequently, the phase of a circadian oscillator could not have supported the difference in revisit rates observed here. The when component of episodic-like memory may be based on a representation of the time of occurrence of events or an estimate of the interval elapsed since the presentation of the distinctive flavors 20 and 21. Alternative approaches for evaluating memory (e.g., memory for sequential order of unique events [22]) may also provide insight into understanding the temporal mechanisms for memories of specific events. The validation of a rodent model of episodic-like memory may open new opportunities to explore the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, neurophysiological, and molecular mechanisms of episodic memory. Development of such animal models holds enormous potential for studying functional changes in episodic memory in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, amnesia, and other human memory pathologies. Twelve Long Evans rats (Harlan, Madison, WI; 300 g, 3 months old) were individually housed in a colony (light onset at 0700, offset at 1900). Each rat received 15 g/day of 5001-Rodent-Diet (Lab Diet, Brentwood, MO). Water was available ad lib, except during brief testing periods. All procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and followed guidelines of the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The 8 arm radial maze (described in 16 and 17) had a central hub and eight guillotine doors and arms. A food trough and a 45 mg pellet dispenser were located at the end of each arm. A photobeam in the trough detected head entries. Additional photobeams in each arm were 3.8 and 5.1 cm from guillotine doors. White noise masked outside noise. Experimental events (guillotine doors and food) were computer controlled from an adjacent room. Data (photobeam breaks) were recorded (10 ms resolution) with MED-PC software (version 4.1). Chow pellets (PJAI-0045, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) were placed in each arm and trough. In each of 2 days, one randomly chosen arm contained grape pellets (PJAI-G-0045, Research Diets) and a different randomly chosen arm contained raspberry pellets (PJAI-R-0045, Research Diets). During initial training, rats were individually placed in the central hub beginning at 0830; all eight doors were then opened. A visit was defined by the interruption of a food-trough photobeam; interruption of the photobeam near the guillotine door was required before the next interruption of a food-trough photobeam counted as a visit. Food was dispensed into a trough contingent upon interrupting the photobeam located in that trough. Arms containing regular food each dispensed one pellet per day. Arms (randomly selected each day) containing the distinctive foods (grape and raspberry) could dispense three pellets per visit. Rats could revisit locations with distinctive foods up to five times and receive three pellets per visit (additional food was not available after the fifth visit). Ten daily sessions ended when food was earned at each location or 10 min had elapsed. Subsequent training trials consisted of two shifts per day. Rats were individually placed in the hub beginning at 0830 for a study phase. Four doors (randomly chosen for each rat each day) were opened, with the restriction that one arm dispensed three grape pellets and one arm dispensed three raspberry pellets; all other accessible arms dispensed one regular pellet. Pellet(s) were delivered to accessible troughs contingent on the first interruption of the photobeam located in the trough. The study phase ended (and the rat was removed) when food had been dispensed at each of the four accessible locations. Each animal was later returned to the hub for a test phase with eight doors open. In the test phase, chow-flavored food was available at each arm not previously accessible in the study phase. On days with a short retention interval, the interval between study and test phases was 1 hr, and the only locations that provided food in the test phase were the four arms not available during the study phase. On days with a long retention interval, the interval between study and test phases was 6 hr; the test phase was identical to the short retention interval condition, except that the locations with distinctive foods also replenished (i.e., grape and raspberry were available during the test phase at locations that provided these food types during the study phase). After a long retention interval, rats could visit each location with distinctive food up to five times and receive three pellets per visit. The test phase ended when food had been dispensed at each of the baited locations (i.e., after 4 or 6 different arms had provided food in short or long retention intervals, respectively). On any given day, a short or long retention interval (but not both) was tested. Blocks of trials with short retention intervals alternated with blocks of trials with long retention intervals. Each block differed only in retention interval and consisted of 10–15 trials. Rats received 80 trials consisting of three blocks each of short and long retention-interval trials. The retention interval was randomly selected to be short or long for each of 20 trials. In all other respects, mixed testing was the same as block testing. Satiation began 4 hr after a study phase during a long retention interval. Each rat was given three cycles of 30 min access to 10 g of one distinctive food type followed by 10 min without access to food. Rats were returned to the maze for a test phase at the end of the long retention interval, which occurred 10 min after the last bowl of food was removed. Each rat was tested with each flavor as the devalued food once; the order of grape and raspberry was counterbalanced across rats. There were nine mixed sessions between the first and second satiation manipulations. Rats received nine trials of mixed short and long retention-interval trials. The procedure was the same as in mixed testing, except that banana (PJAI-Ban-0045, Research Diets) and chocolate (F0299, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) were used as the distinctive pellets instead of grape and raspberry. The first and second transfer trials were long and short retention intervals, respectively. Taste aversion occurred immediately after a study phase during a long retention interval. Rats were given access to 15 g of chocolate for 30 min and were injected with an isotonic solution of LiCl in distilled water (0.75 mol/L, 0.6 ml/100 g of body weight ip) approximately 10 min after food removal. The test phase was identical to previous test phases after long retention intervals, except that the trial ended after the first four choices or 20 min had elapsed. One trial with LiCl was conducted. Maze arms were cleaned with Nolvasan (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) between each study and test phase. All food types used in the experiment were placed beside the filled pellet dispensers (i.e., food odors were constant throughout all parts of the experiment). The reported data come from trials in which the retention intervals were randomly mixed across days. The dependent measure was the probability of revisiting a location with a distinctive food type during the first four visits that occurred in the test phase. For estimates of accuracy in avoiding chow-flavored locations, a correct visit was defined as visiting an arm that was baited with food, and the analysis of the first four choices was restricted to the six nondistinctive arms. Within-subjects repeated-measures statistics (analyses of variance and t tests) were used [23]. This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health grants MH64799 and MH64799-S1 to J.D.C.

Traditional views of group-size evolution focus on ecological factors such as predation risk and physical resources, but the additional factor of time has remained largely unexplored. Time is a valuable limited resource for all animals, and its partitioning both is influenced by sociality and may constrain sociality. Time allocation may in fact be an important mechanism through which predation risk, resource needs and other factors influence the evolution of group size. Classic group-size and time-use hypotheses make no consistent evolutionary predictions, so comparative analyses are necessary to determine which of the predicted processes are active on broad evolutionary scales. To evaluate these predictions, we conducted a comparative study using 50 species of diurnal primates as a model taxon for cohesive group-living animals. The evolution of group size was correlated with time spent resting, even after controlling for life-history variables such as body mass and diet type. We suggest that constraints on time allocation should be better integrated into models of the causes and consequences of sociality and that these constraints may have implications for conservation.},

In two experiments, American undergraduates and Shuar hunter-horticulturalists participated in computer tasks in which they predicted hits and misses in foraging for fruits, coin tosses, and several other kinds of resources whose distributions were generated randomly. Subjects in both populations exhibited the hot hand assumption across all the resource types. The only exception was for American students predicting coin tosses where hot hand was reduced. These data suggest that hot hand is our evolved psychological default, which can be reduced (though not eliminated) by experience with genuinely independent random phenomena like coin tosses.},

We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes.

Similarly, cultural transmission between peers, and between adults and children who are not their offspring, is widely believed to result in groups exchanging cultural traits ("ethnogenesis"). However, neither of these assumptions has been examined empirically. Here, we test them using ethnographic data on craft learning in Iranian tribal populations and the cladistic method of phylogenetic analysis. We find that parent-to-child transmission dominates learning during childhood, but the other two forms of interindividual transmission become more important in later periods. The latter do not, however, appear to have resulted in extensive exchange of cultural traits among tribes. Instead we find that most of the variation among the tribes' craft assemblages can be explained by descent with modification. This can be accounted for by the fact that weavers usually only share their knowledge with members of their own tribe and are prevented from interacting with women from other groups by social norms. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between processes of cultural evolution at the level of the individual and processes of cultural evolution at the level of the group is more complex than is usually acknowledged, and highlight the need for more integrated studies of the processes operating at both scales.},

The present study aims to confirm the occurrence of consolation in captive chimpanzees via the post-conflict/matched-control method (PC-MC) and to suggest its possible roles. We collected 273 PC-MC pairs in the group of Pan troglodytes housed in the ZooParc de Beauval (France). We confirmed the presence of consolatory contacts (mean level of consolation, 49.5\% � 22.3\% SEM) in the colony. Consolation rates were significantly higher than reconciliation levels (mean level of reconciliation, 28.9\% � 16.8\% SEM). The level of consolation was greater in the absence of reconciliation than in the presence of it, suggesting that consolation might be an alternative behavior. As friendship and relatedness did not influence the occurrence of consolation, they did not seem to be the best prerequisites for this behavioral mechanism, at least in this chimpanzee colony. Affinitive contacts with third parties were significantly more frequent when the victim called attention to itself during severe aggressions by screaming. These high-pitched sounds seem to be useful in eliciting aid from conspecifics, as occurs in young humans. The occurrence of consolation reduced the likelihood of further attacks among group-members. From this perspective, both victims and consolers most likely gain potential advantages by interacting with each other when aggression is particularly severe, reconciliation is not immediate, and consequently social stress reaches high levels.

	abstract = {Modern neuroscience is beginning to substantiate Darwin's notion that the roots of human morality lie in social instincts, present in several species. The role of primitive motivational-emotional systems in human morality still remains under-recognized, however. Based on recent experimental evidence and classic neuroanatomical data, we here portray a view of how "ancient" limbic-neurohumoral systems of social attachment and aversion are crucially involved in human moral behaviors, including altruism, empathic concern and aggression. Rather than being a mere evolutionary remnant of our ancestors, such limbic-neurohumoral systems are tightly integrated with cortical mechanisms to enable complex moral sentiments and values, which powerfully influence our choices in socio-cultural settings. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of human social attachment and aversion will provide new insights and foster novel experimental paradigms for the study of moral cognition and behavior.},

	abstract = {Teaching has long been a neglected area in animal behaviour, despite its relevance for a wide range of topics. In light of recent evidence for teaching in nonhuman animals, research can begin to examine the conditions under which it may evolve. Here, we make the case for an evolutionary perspective that treats teaching as a form of cooperative behaviour which functions to promote learning in others. We outline its key characteristics and discuss the selection pressures that may favour its evolution. Teaching will be favoured by selection only where the costs to teachers of facilitating learning are outweighed by the long-term fitness benefits they accrue once pupils have learned, and these benefits will be scaled by the ease with which pupils could learn without teaching. This perspective allows us to make predictions as to the distribution of teaching, the forms it may take, and the relation between teaching in humans and other species. We conclude by considering how teaching may best be categorized. We suggest that natural selection is likely to favour different forms of teaching, depending on whether it serves to promote learning of procedural or declarative information.},

Because mammalian organisms are capable of relating bodily states, intrinsic brain states (e.g. basic attentional, emotional and motivational systems) and environmental stimuli to various life-supporting goal-orientations, SRP appears to be a core ability preserved across numerous species.

This effect holds between sexes and species during the breeding season.

Therefore technique acquisition of socially bonded dyads (pairs) and socially indifferent dyads (non-pairs) was compared. The results can not falsify the hypothesis of individual learning regardless of the partner's knowledge about a successful technique. Pair members did not learn faster from each other than members of non-pair dyads. Pair members did not preferentially acquire the same technique. There was no indication that the rate of technique acquisition within the flock increased with the number of established technicians.

Abundant indirect evidence supports the cryptic female choice (CFC) explanation of this pattern, which supposes that male genitalia often function to court females during copulation; but direct experimental demonstrations of a stimulatory function have been lacking. In this study, we altered the form of two male genital structures that squeeze the female's abdomen rhythmically in Glossina pallidipes flies. As predicted by theory, this induced CFC against the male: ovulation and sperm storage decreased, while female remating increased. Further experiments showed that these effects were due to changes in tactile stimuli received by the female from the male's altered genitalia, and were not due to other possible changes in the males due to alteration of their genital form. Stimulation from male genital structures also induces females to permit copulation to occur. Together with previous studies of tsetse reproductive physiology, these data constitute the most complete experimental confirmation that sexual selection (probably by CFC) acts on the stimulatory properties of male genitalia.},

Once the potential pilferers have left, they move caches those birds have seen, re-hiding them in new places. Naive birds that had no thieving experience do not do so. By focusing on the counter strategies of the cacher when previously observed by a potential pilferer, these results raise the intriguing possibility that re-caching is based on a form of mental attribution, namely the simulation of another bird's viewpoint. Furthermore, the jays also keep track of the observer which was watching when they cached and take protective action accordingly, thus suggesting that they may also be aware of others' knowledge states.},

While numerous reports indicate that male rats with a history of PS are vulnerable to psychiatric disease-like symptoms and drugs of abuse, comparable studies with females have been more limited. Here, the effects of PS in male and female rats were compared with the use of two well-validated tests of drug abuse susceptibility -- the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and the expression of sensitization to the drug's psychomotor-activating properties. When a low dose (0.2 mg/kg/infusion) was available for self-administration across 15 1-hour test sessions, drug-taking behaviors were unaffected by an individual's early-life stress history. On an escalating-doses regimen (0.3-0.5 mg/kg/infusion) of self-administration, however, exposure to PS selectively facilitated the rate of acquisition and overall drug intake of males. Conversely, cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization was augmented by PS in females, but not males. We conclude that exposure to PS enhances the reinforcing and psychomotor-sensitizing properties of cocaine male and female rats, respectively, later in life. Thus, these results suggest that gestational stress is a sex-specific risk factor for different aspects of substance abuse.},

	abstract = {In the field, phenotypic determinants of competitive success are not always absolute. For example, contest experience may alter future competitive performance. As future contests are not determined solely on phenotypic attributes, prior experience could also potentially alter phenotype-fitness associations. In this study, we examined the influence of single and multiple experiences on contest outcomes in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus. We also examined whether phenotype-fitness associations altered as individuals gained more experience. Using both size-matched contests and a tournament design, we found that both winning and losing experience affected future contest success; males with prior winning experience were more likely to win subsequent contests. Although experience was a significant determinant of success in future contests, male weight was approximately 1.3 times more important than experience in predicting contest outcomes. Despite the importance of experience in determining contest outcomes, patterns of selection did not change between rounds. Overall, our results show that experience can be an important determinant in contest outcomes, even in short-lived invertebrates, and that experience alone is unlikely to alter phenotype-fitness associations.},

In contrast, after one brief experience they return to flowers they have left with food remaining. To determine whether hummingbirds primarily use spatial or colour/pattern cues to return to previously visited flowers, two field experiments were performed. In the first, subjects fed from a reward flower and on their subsequent return had to choose between visual cues that were dissociated from spatial cues. The birds showed a marked preference for returning to the correct location of the previously visited flower and not to the flower bearing the appropriate colour/pattern. The second experiment involved a delayed-matching-to-location task in which the subjects fed from, but did not deplete, a focal flower and on return had to choose between the focal flower and a new distractive flower. The latter was presented at three different distances from the focal flower and was either the same or different in colour to the focal flower. Subjects most often chose the focal flower when the distractive flower was of a different colour, whereas performance was poor when it resembled the focal flower. However, a significant interaction between the colour and distance of the distractive flower suggests that the hummingbirds were able to discriminate between focal and distractive flowers under both conditions, but that they employed different foraging tactics according to the colour of the distractive flower in the choice phase.},

	abstract = {1Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, UK In many animal groups, certain individuals consistently appear at the forefront of coordinated movements [1], [2], [3] and [4]. How such leaders emerge is poorly understood [5] and [6]. Here, we show that in pairs of sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, leadership arises from individual differences in the way that fish respond to their partner's movements. Having first established that individuals differed in their propensity to leave cover in order to look for food, we randomly paired fish of varying boldness, and we used a Markov Chain model to infer the individual rules underlying their joint behavior. Both fish in a pair responded to each other's movements—each was more likely to leave cover if the other was already out and to return if the other had already returned. However, we found that bolder individuals displayed greater initiative and were less responsive to their partners, whereas shyer individuals displayed less initiative but followed their partners more faithfully; they also, as followers, elicited greater leadership tendencies in their bold partners. We conclude that leadership in this case is reinforced by positive social feedback. Author Keywords: SYSNEURO   We investigated how individuals in a pair respond to one another's movements by setting up a simple scenario in which fish were forced to leave cover occasionally in order to look for food in a “risky” environment. Twenty pairs of fish (all of similar sizes) were each placed in a separate tank that had a “safe” resting area (deep water with some weeds) at one end and a “risky” area (shallow with no shelter) at the other, in which to look for food. For the first four days, an opaque partition prevented fish in the same tank from seeing each other. Each fish was placed in the tank for one hour per day, and a bloodworm (Chironomid larva) was provided every 30 min in the exposed area in order to train the fish to expect food there. After this “training” period, we ran two 1 hr assessments (without delivery of food) during which we recorded the timing of all transitions out of and back into cover (a fish was defined as under cover if partially or wholly obscured by weed when viewed from directly above). On average, individuals made 32.4 ± 4.3 (mean ± SE) trips out of cover during each 1 hr assessment, which led to their being exposed for 27.8 ± 3.5\% of the time. We counted each time a fish left cover as one trip. For each individual, we fitted a continuous-time Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model [19] in which a fish could be in one of two states: safe (under cover) or exposed. We estimated for each individual fish the tendencies (technically, the transition intensities) to leave cover and to return to cover. Fish temperament [12], [13] and [20] was then defined as the ratio between the two transition intensities, such that large values of our temperament score would imply a relatively stronger tendency to leave cover and small values a relatively stronger tendency to return to cover. After a final day of training during which food was again provided for reinforcement of the expectation that food might be found in the exposed, risky area, we randomly paired fish and used our temperament score to define a “bold” fish (relatively stronger tendency to leave cover) and a “shy” fish (relatively stronger tendency to return to cover) within each of the 20 pairs [10], [20], [21], [22], [23] and [24]. We ran the main experiment over the next four days, during which time no food was delivered in the tank. On two of the days (either the 1st and 3rd or the 2nd and 4th), we recorded the movement of each pair when separated by an opaque partition as in the experiments above (control), whereas on the two remaining days we used a transparent partition that allowed the fish to see each other and thus to potentially interact. When the fish could not see each other, the bolder fish in each pair made 48.1 ± 6.6 trips out of cover, spending 41.3 ± 5.4\% of time exposed, whereas the shyer member of the pair made 17.3 ± 2.4 trips and spent 14.3 ± 3.5\% of time exposed (no difference from their behavior during the previous week, p ≥ 0.17 for all paired t tests). When members of a pair were allowed to see each other, both the bolder and the shyer fish significantly increased the number of trips (64.3 ± 5.5 and 43.6 ± 4.7 trips respectively) and the amount of time spent out of cover (50.8 ± 4.5\% and 33.0 ± 4.8\% of time; p ≤ 0.019 for all paired t tests comparing the transparent with the opaque runs). When fish were allowed to see each other, the pair also synchronized their trips out of cover, quantifiable by a measure of synchronization analogous to genetic linkage disequilibrium [17] and [25] (sync scores in transparent versus sync scores in opaque: 0.81 ± 0.03 versus −0.15 ± 0.11; four measurements from each of 20 pairs; ANOVA blocked by fish pair: F1,59 = 183.2, p {\textless} 0.001). These synchronized movements were led mostly by the bold fish, which initiated 20.2 ± 2.1 joint trips (averaging across both transparent runs for all pairs), versus only 10.0 ± 1.4 joint trips initiated by the shy fish. We counted one joint trip whenever, beginning with both fish under cover, one fish (the leader) left cover and, before returning, was joined by the other (the follower). To determine how the bold individual emerged as leader, we used a continuous-time MCMC model with four possible, numbered states (Figure 1A): 1, both fish safe (under cover); 2, bold fish exposed, shy fish safe; 3, bold fish safe, shy fish exposed; and 4, both fish exposed. The transition intensities from this model provide us with a precise description of the behavior of both the bold and the shy fish and the way in which they respond to one another's movements (qij denotes the transition intensity from state i to state j). The tendency to leave cover when the partner is still concealed (q12 for the bold fish or q13 for the shy fish) gives us an individual's “initiative,” which may differ from its tendency to join a trip out of cover initiated by the other individual (“gregariousness”; q34 for bold or q24 for shy). Similarly, the tendency of a fish to remain out of cover by itself while the other individual is concealed (its “determination”; the inverse of q21 for bold or of q31 for shy) differs from its tendency to remain out of cover during a joint trip (its “faithfulness”; the inverse of q43 for bold or of q42 for shy). Figure 1A illustrates this model fitted to the transparent runs, during which the fish could see each other. Inspection of the transition intensities in Figure 1A reveals that the bold fish in a pair was more likely to leave cover than was the shy fish, both on its own (when its partner was under cover) and in company (when its partner was already out of cover). We can also see that the fish responded to each other, as we expected from the synchronization scores discussed earlier: both fish were more likely to leave cover if their partner was already out (q34 {\textgreater} q12, p {\textless} 0.001; q24 {\textgreater} q13, p {\textless} 0.001) and were less likely to return to cover under the same circumstances (q43 {\textless} q21, p {\textless} 0.001; q42 {\textless} q31, p {\textless} 0.001; Figure 1A). Constraining the model so that the possibility of such responses was ingnored (i.e., requiring that the tendencies to leave or to return to cover should be identical regardless of whether the partner is under cover or not, so that q12 = q34, q13 = q24, q21 = q43, and q31 = q42) leads to a significant decrease in fit (χ24 = 2327.8, p {\textless} 0.001). Reassuringly, if we fit the same model to the runs with an opaque partition, during which the fish could not see each other, we obtain the opposite result, with the simpler model in which fish cannot respond to one another's movements (Figure 1B) giving the best fit (allowing for such responses leads to no increase in the explanatory power of the model: χ24 {\textless} 0.1, p = 0.99). Transition intensities estimated from the opaque runs were also highly correlated with estimates from individual runs in the previous week (r38 = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.001). Comparing the transition intensities estimated from the opaque runs and the intensities from the transparent runs allows us investigate the degree to which the two fish differ in their responses to one another. In opaque runs, for the bold fish, we write b+ for the transition intensity out of cover and b− for the transition intensity back into cover; equivalent intensities for the shy fish are denoted s+ and s−. Although both fish increased their tendency to leave cover (both initiating and joining) when they could see one another compared to when they were in isolation, the proportional increase for the shy fish was significantly greater than that for the bold fish (initiating: q13 / s+ = 1.82 ± 0.11for shy, versus q12 / b+ = 1.51 ± 0.05 for bold, p = 0.007; joining: q24 / s+ = 5.52 ± 0.27 for shy, versus q34 / b+ = 3.73 ± 0.19 for bold, p {\textless} 0.001). Compared with isolated individuals, fish that could see their partner were also more likely to return to cover if exposed alone, and the proportional increase was once again greater for the shy fish (q31 / s− = 2.69 ± 0.15 for shy, versus q21 / b− = 1.72 ± 0.06 for bold, p {\textless} 0.001). When exposed in company, however, fish that could see their partner were less likely to return to cover than were isolated individuals, and the proportional decrease was greater for the bold fish (q42 / s− = 0.81 ± 0.04 for shy, versus q43 / b− = 0.48 ± 0.02 for bold, p {\textless} 0.001). The above results show that bold and shy fish differ in their social behavior. If the crude, dichotomous definition of “shy” and “bold” is so informative, it is reasonable to ask whether a more refined definition of temperament would do better. We tackled this question by fitting our measures of individual temperament (the ratio of leaving cover intensity versus returning to cover intensity that was estimated for each fish in isolation with the opaque partition) as covariates in the MCMC model describing movement of the pair with the transparent partition. Including the individual temperament scores of both fish led to a significant increase in model fit (χ216 = 1302.1, p {\textless} 0.001; Figures 2A and 2B), and it was superior to considering the detailed temperament of only one of the two fish (bold fish temperament: χ28 = 425.7, p {\textless} 0.001; shy fish temperament: χ28 = 834.4, p {\textless} 0.001). For both the bold and the shy individual, fish with a stronger propensity to leave cover in isolation with the opaque partition (large temperament score) showed a similar behavior when in a pair, as denoted by significant positive effects of an individual's temperament score on the transition intensities associated with that individual leaving cover by itself (95\% CI: 0.487 {\textless} β12 {\textless} 0.574 for bold; 95\% CI: 1.320 {\textless} σ13 {\textless} 1.742 for shy; Figures 2A and 2B), and, for the shy fish, a significant negative effect on its tendency to return to cover when exposed alone (95\% CI: −1.075 {\textless} σ31 {\textless} −0.613). Similar effects were seen in the transitions that refer to joint trips, with significant positive effect of a fish's temperament on its tendency to leave cover to join a companion (for bold, 95\% CI: 0.268 {\textless} β34 {\textless} 0.468; for shy, 95\% CI: 0.489 {\textless} σ24 {\textless} 0.76) and, for the bold fish, a significant negative effect on its tendency to terminate that joint trip (95\% CI: −0.394 {\textless} β43 {\textless} −0.232). In addition, an individual's temperament affected not only its own behavior but also that of its partner; constraining the MCMC model by fixing at zero the influence of each fish's temperament score on transition intensities corresponding to movement of the other fish led to a significant decrease in fit (χ28 = 331.8, p {\textless} 0.001). By contrast, the same constraint leads to no loss of fit when the model is applied to runs with the opaque partition (χ28 {\textless} 0.1, p {\textgreater} 0.9). A bold fish with a higher temperament score proved a more convincing leader, increasing the tendency of the shy fish to join it out of cover (95\% CI: 0.291 {\textless} β24 {\textless} 0.407) and decreasing its tendency to abandon a joint trip (95\% CI: −0.178 {\textless} β42 {\textless} −0.076). The shy fish also became more prone to return to cover when exposed alone if it was paired with a bold fish with a high temperament score (95\% CI: 0.488 {\textless} β31 {\textless} 0.648). A shy fish with a relatively lower temperament score had an even more dramatic effect on its partner, as the bold fish became more prone to leave cover on its own (95\% CI: −0.671 {\textless} σ12 {\textless} −0.311) and less likely to return to cover if exposed alone (95\% CI: 0.066 {\textless} σ21 {\textless} 0.372). Thus, very bold individuals made better leaders, enhancing the followership characteristics of their shy partners. At the same time, very shy individuals made better followers and elicited greater leadership tendencies in their bold partners. In summary, our results show that leadership can emerge from temperamental differences between members of a pair, which influence the way in which individuals respond to one another. Bolder individuals emerged as leaders not only because of their greater tendency to leave cover (which was apparent both in a pair and in isolation) but also because they were less responsive to the movements of their partners. By contrast, it was the shyer individuals, which were more strongly influenced by their partners' behavior, that emerged as followers. It is also clear, however, that these pre-existing temperamental differences are reinforced by social feedback—a bold, unresponsive individual induced greater followership characteristics in its partner, whereas a shy, responsive individual had the opposite effect, inducing leadership characteristics. Models of self-organization have had great success in explaining how complex group movements can arise from the interaction of individuals following simple rules [5], [14], [15], [16] and [18], particularly in large, homogeneous associations of social insects [16], [26], [27], [28] and [29]. Our results imply that the power of this approach, as well as its applicability to vertebrates [14], may be still further enhanced by taking into account variation among individual group members in the rules that they follow, particularly the ways in which they respond to one another [6]. When individuals are capable of perceiving and responding to the individual temperaments of their social partners (as is the case in our study), the behavior of a group is likely to reflect its composition in terms of individual “personalities.” Paradoxically, a deeper understanding of collective action may thus depend upon the study of differences in the behavior of individuals. A stock of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, was collected from the Swaffham Bulbeck area of the River Cam (UK) during 2006 and kept in a lab at 17°C ± 1°C on a 10L:14D light regime for at least one month before being used in experiments. All fish were taken from the same population, because variation in personality may be influenced by evolutionary history [21]. Fish were kept in large glass aquaria with dual filtration systems (under-gravel and external Hagen filters). Tanks were lined with gravel and contained a number of plastic plants (Hagen). The sex of individual sticklebacks was not established, but the standard laboratory temperature used prevented them from coming into breeding condition [30]. Fish used in experiments were of similar length (45 mm ± 5 mm from tip of snout to peduncle), for removal of size as a potentially confounding variable [31]. All sticklebacks were fed to satiation daily on frozen bloodworms (Chironomid larvae). All experiments were approved by the Animal Users Management Committee of the University of Cambridge. Fish to be trained for experiments were moved to partitioned holding tanks (60 cm × 30 cm × 40 cm). Each glass tank held six fish in individual compartments, which were separated by transparent plastic partitions. This allowed individual fish identification but minimized any stress caused by isolation. Under-gravel filtration operated over the whole system, and each compartment had a plastic plant at one end and a white plastic tile (approximately 1.5 cm2), onto which food was delivered, at the other. During training and observation, fish were transferred to glass experimental tanks (90 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm; see Figure S1, available online). The walls of these tanks were covered with black opaque plastic, preventing external movement from being seen by the fish. Each tank was partitioned lengthwise with either an opaque or a transparent plastic barrier, forming two long compartments. The tanks were lined with white gravel in such a way that a slope was created from a deep end, with a water depth of 12 cm, to a shallow feeding end, with a water depth of 2 cm. Two plastic plants (Hagen) were placed in the deep end of each compartment, and a feeding tile similar to those used in the holding tanks was placed at the other end. A small, vertical, white plastic screen (8 cm × 8 cm, visible above the gravel) was put in front of each feeding tile, preventing fish at the shallow end of the tank from seeing food at the deep end. Water was aerated when fish were not present in the tank. After the fish were allowed five minutes for acclimation to the new environment, their behavior was recorded with a Sony DCR-35E digital video camera, mounted directly above each tank, aligned to give a full view of the whole tank. Data were collected in fortnightly cycles, with fish spending one hour each weekday in the experimental tanks for either training or experimental purposes. The first three days of a cycle were used for training purposes and carried out with the use of the opaque partition for the prevention of visual contact between individuals. Before any hour-long session, a single medium-sized bloodworm was placed onto the feeding tile in each tank. Fish were then individually moved from the holding tanks to the deep end of an experimental tank. After 30 min, tanks were inspected, and a second bloodworm was placed on the tile if the first had been consumed. Any fish that failed to consume two bloodworms on any given day were fed in the holding tanks after training, ensuring that all fish received the same quantity of food during the cycle. After three days, fish that had failed to eat any bloodworms during training were excluded from the experiment, and the rest then underwent “individual temperament” assessments. This was done through video recordings of the fish in the experimental tanks (with opaque barriers) for an hour on each of the two following days. No bloodworms were provided in the tanks during this assessment (as feeding could influence foraging tendencies); fish were fed a single bloodworm each upon being returned to the holding tanks. See below for details of how temperament was scored. Over the weekend, sticklebacks were not trained but were left in their individual holding tanks and fed daily with one bloodworm. Assessed fish were assigned to pairs. All of these fish individually underwent an additional day of training at the start of the second week, after having not been exposed to food in the experimental tanks over the four previous days. The final four days of the experimental cycle were used for testing the response to a foraging partner. Each pair was observed twice with an opaque partition and twice with a transparent partition. No food was given each day until the tests had been completed. Videos were played back at four times the normal speed, and we recorded the timing of all transitions into and out of cover using a custom-designed data logger. To assess temperament when fish were in isolation, we fitted a continuous-time MCMC model [19], in which a fish could be in two states (under cover, i.e., partially or wholly obscured by weed when viewed from above; or exposed). The model was fitted with the package msm v0.8 (written by Christopher Jackson) in R 2.7.0 (R Core Development Team). Temperament was measured as the relative tendency to leave rather than to return to cover; i.e., the ratio of the transition intensity for leaving cover to the transition intensity for returning to cover. Previous work has shown that individual sticklebacks show consistent responses to predation risk [10] and [21]. Temperament scores obtained for the same fish during the initial assessments were highly correlated with estimates obtained a week later during the main experiment when the opaque partition was in place (r38 = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.001). We investigated the interaction of pairs of individuals by fitting a continuous-time MCMC model with four possible states: both fish under cover, one fish exposed and one under cover (two possible states), and both fish exposed. The fish with a higher temperament score within the pair was termed “bold,” and the fish with a lower score “shy” (Figure S2). To test whether a fish's behavior was affected by its partner, we also fitted models in which selected transition intensities were constrained to be equal and compared the fit of these reduced models against that of the more general model. The comparison was conducted with a log-likelihood ratio test, which follows a χ2 distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models. We also expanded the (unconstrained) model to include the fish-temperament scores during the trials with an opaque partition as covariates. In this way, we were able to determine whether temperament (measured during the experiments with an opaque partition) influenced transition probabilities (during the experiments with a transparent partition).

	abstract = {1Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3EB, UK 2Sub-department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 8AA, UK Of the 120 species of birds in the corvid family, which includes the crows, ravens, magpies and jays, the bare-faced rook is perhaps the most social of them all. At a rookery in Norfolk, for example, winter roosts can number up to 60,000 individuals. The name for a congregation of rooks is a ‘parliament’. In English folklore, parliament is an apt name for rook justice, as it is said that rooks form a circle around a wrongdoer producing a cacophony of calls and caws which can go on for hours until the offender is either attacked and killed or released to live another day. Although only fiction, such tales reflect their canny reputation as thieves and tricksters, as well as possessors of great wisdom. Like most birds, corvids are monogamous, and the core unit is therefore the mated pair. This pair bond is typically for life, and the pair remains together throughout the year. For example, rooks and ravens find a partner during the autumn months, taking part in impressive aerobatic displays and food sharing which may be to assess the quality of a potential mate. Once juvenile rooks and ravens pair, they engage in extensive mutual preening and bill twining (bill holding) and support one another in fights. The details of corvid sociality vary from species to species, and even population to population (Table 1). For example, raven pairs prefer to nest in the privacy of their own large territory, whereas rook pairs find a micro-territory, a nest site within a large colony of tens or hundreds of individual nests, called a rookery. In both species, this territory (or micro-territory) is usually occupied for life. Once the juveniles become fully independent, they leave the natal area and sometimes join other juveniles to form ‘teenage’ gangs of vagrants. This behaviour has been well documented for ravens capitalising on food bonanzas. Whilst raven pairs remain in their territory, rook pairs range alone until later in the year when they join massive winter roosts containing thousands of individuals. This social variation in rooks, as well as other colonial corvids such as pinyon jays, is suggestive of the fission–fusion societies of chimpanzees, dolphins and spider monkeys. Indeed, seasonal changes in pinyon flock composition are even more complex, demonstrating higher levels of fission–fusion as jays dispersing from neighbouring colonies will join other flocks. Whilst juvenile ravens and rooks form gangs themselves after leaving their parent's territory, pinyon jay offspring form crèches with the offspring of other adults. These crèches are fed and protected by a subset of adults whilst others go off to forage, which probably has had a significant effect on their later socialization. So one of the hallmarks of corvid sociality is behavioural flexibility, and consequently there is considerable variation not only between species but within a species, because of seasonal and ontogenetic changes in the size and composition of the social network. Perhaps the classic case of corvid sociality is the communal cooperative breeding of the Florida scrub-jay. In this system, there are small family groups rather than a large colony. The young are raised not only by the parents, but also by non-breeding relatives, called ‘helpers at the nest’. Such helpers aid in feeding the offspring, but also help in defending the nest and keep a look out for predators. Helping appears to be highly dependent on environmental conditions, and is consequently found in sparse habitats where there are fewer opportunities for young birds successfully to set up their own territories and raise their own young. Further evidence in support of this comes from the fact that in a closely related species, the Western scrub-jay, and a more distantly related species, the carrion crow, there are geographic differences in the prevalence of helping behaviour. In the lush Central Valley of California, scrub-jays primarily live in pairs accompanied by juveniles without territories of their own, whereas in harsher climes, such as Mexico, scrub-jays live in extended family groups with helpers at the nest, just like their sister species the Florida scrub-jay. In the case of carrion crows, it is clear that these variations are not due to genetic differences between populations, but a consequence of differences in habitat. In sparse environments the young birds stay in the natal territory and help rear their parents' young; but in years when adult mortality is high, the juveniles desert to establish their own territory. The Mexican jay is perhaps one of the more extreme cases of this communal cooperative breeding system, as typically two adult pairs share a territory along with various non-breeding helpers, all of whom take part in feeding the young and defending the nests. The differences in social system led Jerram Brown to suggest that there are two alternative routes to sociality in the New World jays; either by progressive overlapping of home ranges together with a reduction of aggressive spacing leading to coloniality, or retention of the young in the territory for increasingly longer periods of time resulting in a communal social structure. We suggest that this evolutionary scenario can in fact be applied to the entire family Corvidae, and we give some examples in Figure 1. Given the prevalence of sociality within most of the corvids which have been studied to date, we think that there is good reason to believe that the common ancestor of the corvids was social. Even in species such as the Clark's nutcracker, which has a relatively simple social structure, family groups may come together in loose flocks once the young have fledged. As we argued in the last section, although corvids generally display great flexibility in their social lives, the core unit is the pair-bond. These life-long, year-round partnerships have important implications for corvid social behaviour. Typically, monogamous birds form pairs in order to raise offspring together and defend their nest; but at the end of the breeding season, the pairs will often split and form new pairs the next year. However, in the case of some corvids, notably rooks and jackdaws, the pairs remain together throughout the year and return to the same nesting site year after year. It is thought that these long-term partnerships resemble the long-term alliances of many primates and dolphins. For example, the relationship between pair mates is established and reinforced through mutual preening and food sharing, and they enhance their dominant status by aiding one another in fights against third parties. In this way, pairs may increase their access to resources that would generally be unavailable to them as singletons. For example, jackdaws form pairs within the first year, probably because good nest sites are difficult to find and there is intense competition for sites with other pairs. Only a strong coordinated partnership has the ability to defend sites against other pairs. Corvids are known for their relatively long period of development, typically several months, before becoming truly independent from their parents. Even so, many young corvids, including rooks and jackdaws, form selective partnerships soon after they start feeding themselves. In the first instance, these are not necessarily with individuals of the opposite sex. In a captive group of rooks, we observed the formation of opposite-sex and same-sex pairs around three months of age. Once the birds became sexually mature, the same sex pairs swapped partners, presumably in preparation for breeding. The individuals in the pairs were strongly affiliative and demonstrated no aggression to one another, in stark contrast to the aggression they directed to other individuals. The behaviour of the pairs was mutualistic, as both members benefited from the partnership, both gaining dominance and both helping one another in fights. Social life has costs as well as benefits. In the competition for resources, it is inevitable that individuals will fight. The larger the social group, the more opportunities there may be for conflict. Consequently, members of a pair engage in a number of tactics to manage the stress associated with aggression and minimise the risk of damaging the partnership. This occurs with active social support either through direct aggression towards the same third party as the partner or direct affiliation towards their partner after they have been the victim or winner of a fight. Both cases are examples of cooperative behaviour, which probably helps maintain social bonds, but in the case of post-conflict affiliation is also important in stress management. If one member of a pair takes part in an agonistic encounter with a third party, either they retreat to their partner after the fight has ended or their partner moves towards them, producing a special affiliative behaviour, bill twining, which is sometimes also called bill holding (Figure 2A). Similar behaviours, such as kissing and embracing, have been reported for chimpanzees after fights. Other examples of affiliative behaviours are preening (Figure 2B), food sharing (Figure 2C), and the bowing and fanning display (Figure 2D). One major difference from chimpanzees is the total absence of reconciliation between former antagonists. It has been suggested that reconciliation only occurs between individuals that have a valuable relationship; such as alliance partners in chimpanzees and life-long pair bonded corvids. We found no evidence that rooks fight with their partners or form affiliations with other colony members, which is probably why there is apparently no need for the birds to repair relationships with other parties. The ability to recognise individuals is an essential precursor for maintaining affiliative relationships, understanding relationships between third parties and classifying individuals based on their social class — parent, sibling, mate, friend, foe or group member. It is particularly important in stable social groups or fission–fusion societies, where individuals may rejoin the group at unpredictable times. Research in a number of corvids has found that they classify individuals based on various social categories. Mexican jays responded to calls played on a speaker with a shorter latency, and came close to the speaker more frequently when the calls were from members of the nearby group compared to when they were from members of their own group, suggesting that they could discriminate between the two. Corvids begin to recognise one another very early in development. Sibling rooks, for example, recognise one another by their calls before fledging, whereas adults can recognise one another by their visual appearance alone. How does recognition occur? One possibility is that individual vocalizations contain a ‘signature’ which is unique to that particular individual in the same way that the configuration of faces is unique to each individual. It has been suggested that this form of categorization occurs through intense socialization with individuals of a particular social class. By this process, individuals which are either strongly bonded, such as monogamous pairs or siblings or parents and offspring, spend a long time in proximity and rapidly learn the physical and/or vocal attributes of that specific individual. In the realm of vocalization, pair-bonded individuals often converge on the same call structure. Vocal sharing occurs with the warble vocalizations within groups of Australian magpies, where magpies in the same group share more warble syllables than magpies of different groups (a similar system occurs for the non-territorial song of American crows). In large social groups with a linear dominance hierarchy, such as many corvid societies, the ability to make inferences about the relative status of individuals within this hierarchy is an important skill, often called transitive inference. For example, if Bob is more dominant than Joe, and Joe is more dominant than Simon, and Bob and Simon have a fight, what would be the predicted outcome? Transitive inference allows an animal to calculate that Bob should out-compete Simon even though Bob and Simon may previously never have interacted. When an arbitrary version of the transitive inference test was presented to social pinyon jays and less social western scrub-jays in the laboratory, the pinyon jays outperformed (learned more quickly than) the scrub-jays. But the scrub-jays did learn the task and with a similar learning curve to the pinyon jays. Pinyon jays have also been tested on a social version of this test. Birds were split into groups, and allowed to observe contests for food between pairs of jays of known dominance from either the same or a different group. For example, bird B was paired with bird A, from the same group (A was dominant to B), or with bird 2 from a different group (birds in the ‘letter’ group were dominant to birds in the ‘number’ group). The observing jay, bird 3, subservient on previous encounters to bird 2, was then allowed to compete with bird B. As bird B was submissive to bird A, but dominant to bird 2, if bird 3 formed a representation of the relative dominance of those birds from the observed encounters, then it should display a greater number of submissive displays to B. This was exactly what they did across many combinations of birds from different groups which had never interacted before. Corvids which live in large, complex social groups have to solve specific social problems associated with competing with others for scarce resources. Transitive inference, recognising third party relationships and tactical deception are potential weapons in the social corvids' cognitive arsenal. However, the social problems faced by less social corvids are not necessarily less complex. Take caching, for example. Many avian and mammalian species hide food, using memory to accurately retrieve their food caches later. For most species, the problems associated with finding hidden food are personal problems. But for caching corvids, the problems are exacerbated by the fact that corvids can remember the location of not only their own caches, but also the caches of others. This observational spatial memory has been suggested to be the cornerstone of how corvid pilferers can steal food without aggressive retaliation from the ‘owner’ of the cache. Corvid cachers therefore need to protect their caches from the possibility of theft when they have left the cache site, as well as protecting their caches aggressively when potential thieves are present. Studies of western scrub-jays and ravens have been particularly illuminating in regard to the cognitive mechanisms involved in protecting caches from conspecifics, and whether such mechanisms may involve the attribution of mental states. When confronted with a potential thief, ravens and scrub-jays will attempt to cache as far as possible from the eyes of the competitor, hide caches out of sight — behind rocks, trees or other barriers — and scrub-jays will even cache in darkened areas rather than sites that are well lit. Such skills suggest visual perspective taking — computing what another can or cannot see. If the situation does not allow the storers to avoid a pilferer's gaze, they will return to their caches at a later time and move them to new places of which the observer was not aware. These protective behaviours are not born with the cachers, they are triggered by experience. In a study of captive scrub-jays, only cachers that had the previous experience of being thieves themselves implemented this strategy of moving their caches to new places, whereas naïve scrub-jays left their caches to their fate at the beaks of the observers. Although adult scrub-jays and ravens do not live in extended social groups, they must have the ability to recognise individuals. Indeed, when confronted with observers of different identities, they only used cache-protection strategies when the earlier observer was a dominant jay. They did not use protective strategies when the observer was their partner or a subordinate. When cachers hid food in different places in front of different observers — for example, when they cached in tray A in front of observer A, and cached in tray B in front of observer B — and they were allowed to recover their caches, in front of either the same two observers or a naïve observer who had not seen the caching, the cachers selectively retrieved those caches from the specific tray in which they had cached in front of a specific observer. They retrieved caches from tray A in front of observer A, but left the other caches alone, so not revealing their location. They did not recover any caches in front of the naïve jay, but recovered a majority of their food when allowed to recover in private. Interestingly, when they recovered in front of either observer, A or B, they moved their caches around multiple times, an avian version of the ‘shell game’. These behaviours are shared with ravens, although it is not yet clear whether these species really recognise the different knowledge states of individuals or they are just responding to subtle behavioural cues of the observer. Not all things are bad in the social lives of corvids. There are benefits for living in a social group outside of the traditional reasons, based on defence against predators or foraging opportunities. One suggestion is that corvids may even be cultural animals. Life in a social group allows the individuals within that group to learn things from others that are either too dangerous for them to learn themselves or too time consuming. Rooks, for example, use social information to locate profitable foraging sites on agricultural land, and in the lab have been shown to exploit novel food sources based on the feeding preferences of conspecifics. Although corvids have yet to be tested for the extent of their social learning abilities, social learning has been suggested to have played a significant role in the spread of the tool manufacture specializations of New Caledonian crows. Laboratory studies suggest that young crows do not appear to require social stimulation to begin using and making tools, but the distribution of different tool types across New Caledonia has been raised as a potential example of cultural variation. The ‘simplest’ tools are found across the island, whereas waves of complexity appear to have spread to pockets across the island. It remains to be determined whether such variability really is a cultural trait or the result of innovation or trial and error learning. We have described a very small subset of the variety of social organization, social behaviour and social cognition of the Corvidae, and much remains to be learned. There are over 120 species of corvids, and yet few have been systematically studied in the lab or the field. We are therefore completely ignorant of the social lives of most of the extant corvids. This article therefore remains a work in progress with exciting prospects ahead, and we hope that this primer, along with the recent suite of studies on the corvids, might inspire more researchers to study these fascinating creatures.},

eggs in a large tray containing wood shavings. They were allowed to make as many caches as they wanted. The birds were then
returned either the same day or the next day to retrieve the pellets. If they returned the same day, one colour of pellets
was replaced with wooden beads of similar size and colour, while if they returned the next day this would happen to the other
colour. Over just a few trials, the birds learned to only search for the food pellets, and ignore the beads, of the appropriate
colour for the given retention interval. A probe trial in which all items were removed showed that the birds persisted in
searching for the pellets and not the beads. This shows that magpies can remember which food item they hoarded where, and
when, even if the food items only differ from each other in their colour and are dispersed throughout a continuous caching

	abstract = {Dominance hierarchies based on resource holding potential (RHP) or age are central to the social structure of many group-living animals. Nonhuman primate females and some other mammals are unusual because ranks can depend on kin support or follow an inverse age-graded pattern independent of kin. Whereas the former hierarchies are mediated by frequent coalitions leading to long-term stability, the latter are unstable due to individualistic contests and occasional revolutionary coalitions. We use mathematical modeling to investigate this variation, based on the interaction of triads, subgroups of the group consisting of 3 individuals. This produces 4 key situations, namely that relationships can be either stable or unstable, and involving coalitionary support or not. Varying the parameter values of our model and applying it to real-world examples, we conclude that the emergence of different dominance hierarchies depends on 6 major factors. In addition to RHP, reproductive skew and demography often suggested previously, we stress the importance of 1) the variance in relatedness; 2) the costs and likelihood of interventions; and 3) the value of resources and rank in different life stages, which might be tightly linked to the life history of a species.},

Reconciliation reduces stress-related behavior of the aggressee. We investigated the influence of various affiliative postconflict behaviors of the aggressor on the aggressor's scratching rates in captive long-tailed macaques: reconciliation, contacts with the aggressee's kin (or substitute reconciliation), and contact with other group members (or triadic affiliation). After a conflict, the aggressor showed an increase in rates of scratching. Scratching rates were reduced after reconciled conflicts compared to nonreconciled conflicts. Substitute reconciliation did not reduce scratching when we controlled for the influence of reconciliation, i.e., the aggressor might not interpret it as a substitute for reconciliation. Triadic affiliation did not reduce scratching rates, hence, triadic affiliation probably does not console the aggressor. Scratching rates after reconciliation are significantly lower than scratching rates after triadic affiliation. This proves that the stress-reducing effect of reconciliation is not due to the calming effect of general body contact but that the stress reduction is specifically associated with contacts with the former opponent. The contestants are anxious about their relationship, and only reconciliation takes away this anxiety. Reconciliation is thus an important social repair strategy.},

Why do young cease begging and so forgo food brought to them by adults? Three explanations have been proposed: (1) adults may not respond to begging anymore and cease feeding begging young; (2) young may voluntarily switch from begging to independent foraging as they gain more rewards from this; (3) young may become unable to produce stimulating begging calls. We tested these three explanations using meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups. Playback of begging calls at groups where begging had naturally ceased provoked adults to resume provisioning, suggesting that adults had not stopped responding to begging. Experimental provision of food to pups mimicking either natural pup feeding or foraging success produced no differences in subsequent changes in begging or foraging behaviour, suggesting that pups were not assessing the most rewarding means of obtaining food and switching from begging to foraging accordingly. The begging calls of pups (aged 40-60 days) were acoustically different to those produced when they were juveniles (aged 100-120 days), and adults discriminated between rate-controlled playbacks of the two age classes of calls, delivering less food to calls of a juvenile than to the same individual's calls recorded when a pup. Adult meerkats paid attention to the acoustic structure of begging calls, and ceased provisioning when the call structure changed. We suggest that older pups are unable to produce stimulating begging calls.},

Improved analytic techniques have allowed primate researchers to reveal intricate social networks based on the exchange of cooperative acts and services. Although nonprimates are known to show similar behavior (e.g., cooperative hunting, food sharing, coalitions) there seems a consensus that social life is less complex than in primates. Here the authors present the first group-level analysis of reciprocity of social interactions in a social carnivore, the ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua). The authors found that support in aggressive conflicts is a common feature in coatis and that this behavior is reciprocally exchanged in a manner seemingly as complex as in primates. Given that reciprocity correlations persisted after controlling for the effect of spatial association and subunit membership, some level of scorekeeping may be involved. Further studies will be needed to confirm our findings and understand the mechanisms underlying such reciprocity, but our results contribute to the body of work that has begun to challenge primate supremacy in social complexity and cognition.

	abstract = {Many species use specific vocalizations that attract conspecifics to food sources or that recruit other group members to inspect secondary predator cues or to mob predators. However, little is known regarding the variation in the acoustic structure of such calls and the associated meaning. In the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, we investigated calls produced in the context of group recruitment to three different stimulus types: (1) secondary predator cues; (2) snakes; and (3) members of rival groups. Calls produced in response to predator faeces differed from the harsher variants elicited by snakes and rival groups, but the latter two elicited similar calls. Only a few calls of intermediate acoustic structure were produced in response to the different stimulus categories. Playbacks of calls elicited by the different stimuli caused individuals to approach the speaker in the same way. However, calls elicited specifically by snakes and rival mongooses resulted in a higher proportion of receivers responding and a faster receiver response than calls elicited by faeces. This suggests a graded rather than a discrete recruitment call system. Thus, despite obvious differences in stimulus type and the purpose of recruitment, the acoustic structure of calls conveys information about the risk of the encountered stimulus and not the stimulus type itself, allowing receivers to adjust their response according to the urgency. Since calling continued for prolonged periods after all group members had gathered around the callers, these calls may also function to deter rivals and to coordinate the subsequent group response.},

	abstract = {Debate about the relative merits of single-species management versus more comprehensive approaches has intensified in recent years. In east-central Florida, USA, land managers use prescribed burns and mechanical cutting to manage and restore scrub habitat to benefit the imperiled Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). However, these land-management techniques may affect non-target taxa, especially the threatened southeastern beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris). We evaluated the collateral effects of single-species land management by trapping P. p. niveiventris and other small rodents in eighteen land-management compartments at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida during 2004-2005. Compartments were managed using either prescribed burns (N = 5), mechanical cutting (N = 6), checkerboarding (cut and uncut lanes alternating and overlapping, followed by a prescribed burn, N = 4) or left unburned and uncut for {\textgreater}50 year (N = 3). P. p. niveiventris was significantly more abundant in compartments managed with prescribed burns (mean ± SE: 4.2 ± 0.7 individuals/transect) than those managed with cutting alone (1.0 ± 0.3) or not managed for {\textgreater}50 y (0.2 ± 0.1 individuals/transect). In contrast, the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) tended to be more abundant in compartments managed with mechanical cutting alone (2.6 ± 0.4 individuals/transect) compared to the other three management strategies (prescribed burns; 1.5 ± 0.4; checkerboarding, 1.1 ± 0.3; not managed, 1.6 ± 0.4 individuals/transect) but these differences were not statistically significant. Abundances of P. p. niveiventris and Florida Scrub-Jay breeding groups were positively correlated (r = 0.655), suggesting that both listed species benefit from similar management techniques. Thus, the mosaic of burned and cut patches used to improve habitat for the Florida Scrub-Jay also benefits an endemic, non-target species. Single-species management may benefit multiple species when restoration improves their shared habitat, which in this case is an endangered, fire-dependent ecosystem: Florida scrub.},

The birds searched preferentially for fresh wax worms if they had cached them 4 hr earlier but rapidly learned to search for peanuts and avoid decayed wax worms that had been cached 124 hr previously. This pattern also was observed when the food items were removed before recovery on test trials. These results were replicated in Experiment 2 using a procedure in which both types of food were cached in different sides of the same caching tray: On the basis of a single, trial-unique experience, scrub jays could remember the relative time of caching as well as what type of food was cached in each cache site.

Breeding density and cavity use were compared with those of the same colonies in previous years, when no food was provided. Predation rate and reproductive parameters were compared with those in the same colonies in previous years and with those of two control colonies, without experimental food. Jackdaws preferred safe cavities with small minimum nest-entrance dimensions and avoided those with a high risk of nest predation. In experimental (fed) colonies, however, there was a tendency to use all cavities, which resulted in an increased breeding density. No nests were preyed upon by Ravens Corvus corax in the experimental colonies because supplemental food favoured group defence by increasing colony size and by increasing the time the Jackdaws spent in the colony. Additional food advanced laying date, increased clutch size independently of laying date and increased fledging success. Supplementary food significantly increased fledging success in less than half of all experimental studies on birds. We suggest that the key to this problem is the species' breeding strategy, and we show that supplementary food significantly increased fledging success in brood-reduction strategist species but not in species which directly adjusted their clutch size.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether altruistic social interest behaviors such as engaging in helping others were associated with better physical and mental health in a stratified random sample of 2016 members of the Presbyterian Church throughout the United States. METHODS: Mailed questionnaires evaluated giving and receiving help, prayer activities, positive and negative religious coping, and self-reported physical and mental health. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis revealed no association between giving or receiving help and physical functioning, although the sample was highly skewed toward high physical functioning. Both helping others and receiving help were significant predictors of mental health, after adjusting for age, gender, stressful life events, income, general health, positive and negative religious coping, and asking God for healing (R2 = .27). Giving help was a more important predictor of better reported mental health than receiving help, and feeling overwhelmed by others' demands was an independent predictor of worse mental health in the adjusted model. Significant predictors of giving help included endorsing more prayer activities, higher satisfaction with prayer life, engaging in positive religious coping, age, female gender, and being a church elder. Frequency of prayer and negative religious coping were not related to giving help. CONCLUSIONS: Helping others is associated with higher levels of mental health, above and beyond the benefits of receiving help and other known psychospiritual, stress, and demographic factors. The links between these findings and response shift theory are discussed, and implications for clinical interventions and future research are described.},

Neither phylogeny, juvenile development mode, nor species sampled account for the relationship. Similar results are found when the hyperstriatum ventrale is lumped with a second DVR structure, the neostriatum. In simple correlations, size of the wulst and the striatopallidal complex is associated with feeding innovation rate, but the two structures are eliminated from the multiple regressions. Our results parallel those on primates showing a correlation between innovation rate and neocortex size and support the idea that the mammalian neocortex and the neostriatum-hyperstriatum ventrale complex in birds have similar integrative roles.},

In these species, the vocal behaviour of adult females is often different from that of the males, but little systematic work has been done. Here, we describe the alarm call system of female Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli, in their natural forest habitat in western Ivory Coast. We found that in response to disturbing events, females produced three basic alarm call types, [`]wak-oos', [`]hoks' and acoustically variable [`]trill' calls, consisting of repeated and rapidly ascending (RRA) pulses, which varied systematically in the temporal and frequency domains. Using observational and experimental data we were able to demonstrate that the RRA calls consisted of four acoustic variants, which could be associated with specific contexts, allowing listeners to draw inferences about the type of disturbance experienced by the caller. We also compared the alarm call behaviour of free-ranging individuals with published results from captivity. As predicted, captive individuals failed to produce predator-specific alarm calls, but they also produced an RRA variant in response to humans that was absent in the wild. We discuss the relevance of these findings in terms of their broader potential impact on evolutionary theories of primate communication.},

Evolutionary theory sets an even broader stage by examining prosociality in all species, including the distinctive human capacity to cooperate in large groups of unrelated individuals. We use evolutionary theory to investigate human prosociality at the scale of a small city (Binghamton, NY), based on survey data and a direct measure of prosocial behavior. In a survey of public school students (Grades 6-12), individual prosociality correlates strongly with social support, which is a basic requirement for prosociality to succeed as a behavioral strategy in Darwinian terms. The most prosocial individuals receive social support from multiple sources (e.g., family, school, neighborhood, religion and extracurricular activities). Neighborhood social support is significant as a group-level variable in addition to an individual-level variable. The median income of a neighborhood does not directly influence individual prosociality, but only indirectly through forms of social support. Variation in neighborhood quality, as measured by the survey, corresponds to the likelihood that a stamped addressed letter dropped on the sidewalk of a given neighborhood will be mailed. We discuss the results in relation to evolutionary theory, the experimental economics literature and the social capital literature in an effort to integrate the study of human prosociality across disciplines.},

	abstract = {Why do societies collapse? We use an individual-based evolutionary model to show that, in environmental conditions dominated by low-frequency variation ("red noise"), extirpation may be an outcome of the evolution of cultural capacity. Previous analytical models predicted an equilibrium between individual learners and social learners, or a contingent strategy in which individuals learn socially or individually depending on the circumstances. However, in red noise environments, whose main signature is that variation is concentrated in relatively large, relatively rare excursions, individual learning may be selected from the population. If the social learning system comes to lack sufficient individual learning or cognitively costly adaptive biases, behavior ceases tracking environmental variation. Then, when the environment does change, fitness declines and the population may collapse or even be extirpated. The modeled scenario broadly fits some human population collapses and might also explain nonhuman extirpations. Varying model parameters showed that the fixation of social learning is less likely when individual learning is less costly, when the environment is less red or more variable, with larger population sizes, and when learning is not conformist or is from parents rather than from the general population. Once social learning is fixed, extirpation is likely except when social learning is biased towards successful models. Thus, the risk of population collapse may be reduced by promoting individual learning and innovation over cultural conformity, or by preferential selection of relatively fit individuals as models for social learning.},

Our analysis highlights the crucial importance of demography for the evolution of helping behaviours. It shows that habitat saturation can have contrasting effects, depending on the form of competition (direct vs. indirect competition) and on the conditionality of helping. In our attempt to bridge the gap between spatial ecology and population genetics, we derive an expression for relatedness that takes into account both habitat saturation and the spatial structure of genetic variation. This analysis helps clarify discrepancies in the results obtained by previous theoretical studies. It also provides a theoretical framework taking into account the interplay between demography and kin selection, in which new biological questions can be explored.},

Bowing was followed mostly by the recipient's moving away or by no apparent response, and only rarely by the allopreening of the actor. Allopreening was performed mostly by socially low-ranking towards high-ranking birds, and both when the actor was dominant to or submissive to the recipient. Bowing and allopreening seemed to be associated with situations of tension.

The hypothesis that these species differ in their long-term ability to remember the locations of caches was tested in the laboratory.

All species performed at levels better than chance overall, but scrub-jays and Mexican jays performed with modest accuracy at all time intervals. Nutcrackers and pinyon jays performed very accurately with 10- and 60-day intervals but not after longer intervals. These results corroborate the species differences in spatial memory that have been observed in previous studies. The performance of scrub- and Mexican jays can, however, be interpreted either as the rapid forgetting of most information or as the long-term retention of a small amount of information. Therefore it cannot be concluded that these four species differ in their long-term spatial memory abilities.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread occurrence of communal breeding in animal societies, the fitness consequences for mothers are poorly understood. One factor that may have an important influence on the net benefits mothers gain from breeding communally is the competitive ability of their offspring, as mothers are likely to gain substantial advantages from producing young who can outcompete the offspring of other females for access to resources. Here, we investigate the factors that influence offspring competition in the communally breeding banded mongoose (Mungos mungo). We show that heavy offspring are more likely to win competitive interactions with their littermates. Heavy offspring also receive more care and are more likely to survive to independence in large communal litters where competition is most intense. Our results also indicate that offspring weight at emergence is positively correlated with the weight of the mother at conception. As a consequence, the offspring of heavy mothers are likely to enjoy marked competitive advantages during early life. Together, our findings strongly suggest that the competitive ability of offspring will influence the costs and benefits that females experience while breeding communally and highlights the need for closer examination of the factors that influence offspring competitive ability and the influence this may have on the evolution of communal breeding.},

In Part I, I use the logic of natural selection to build a theory for how and why seemingly costly displays influence the cognitive processes associated with cultural learning -- why do "actions speak louder than words?" The core idea is that cultural learners can both avoid being manipulated by their models (those they are inclined to learn from) and more accurately assess their belief commitment by attending to displays or actions by the model that would seem costly to the model if he held beliefs different from those he expresses verbally. Part II examines the implications for cultural evolution of this learning bias in a simple evolutionary model. The model reveals the conditions under which this evolved bias can create stable sets of interlocking beliefs and practices, including quite costly practices. Part III explores how cultural evolution, driven by competition among groups or institutions stabilized at alternative sets of these interlocking belief-practice combinations, has led to the association of costly acts, often in the form of rituals, with deeper commitments to group beneficial ideologies, higher levels of cooperation within groups, and greater success in competition with other groups or institutions. I close by discussing the broader implications of these ideas for understanding various aspects of religious phenomena.},

Fathers are expected to discriminate between their children and others' on the basis of phenotypic similarities, and they should allocate resources accordingly. However, studies showing that males assess paternity by phenotype matching are rare. In a polygynous human population of rural Senegal, we examined the relationships between (1) actual father-child resemblance through both the facial and the olfactory phenotypes; (2) fathers' investment of resources in each child; and (3) child nutritional condition. We found that paternal investment was positively related to both face and odour similarities between fathers and children. Additionally, such discriminative paternal investment was linked to the children's health: children who received more investment had better growth and nutritional status. This is the first evidence that paternal investment is associated with father-child resemblance in real human families, and, furthermore, that these discrepancies in paternal investment result in differences in fitness-related traits in children.},

In those countries, where urbanization and agricultural intensification occur at a faster rate than in developed countries, habitat degradation appears to be the leading cause of wildlife loss. During the breeding seasons of 2002-2005 we conducted road surveys across five biomes of Argentina to detect variations in raptor community attributes as potential indicators of broad scale habitat degradation. Abundance of individuals, richness and diversity of species were calculated to assess the effects of habitat transformation and patch size on these community attributes. Raptor communities strongly varied in relation to habitat transformations, with lower abundance of individuals, richness and diversity of species in more transformed landscapes. Small patches of natural vegetation and locations in which natural and cultivated lands where interspersed showed lower richness and diversity of raptors than large patches. Fragmentation was the main cause of reductions in abundance of individuals. Although the relative contribution of our two estimates of habitat degradation to abundance, richness and diversity of raptors varied among biomes, these community attributes proved useful as predictors of habitat degradation. This was especially true in habitats where raptor communities are more complex although overall patterns remained constant across biomes, from forests to deserts. Taking into account current trends of habitat transformation (drastic increments in monocultures, urban areas, and habitat patchiness), the conservation of raptor communities in these biomes could be seriously compromised. In terms of species-specific responses of raptors to habitat degradation, a rapid process of homogenization can be expected, resulting in only a few winner species within a general scenario of losers.},

	abstract = {Chronic nutritional stress can have a negative impact on an individual's learning ability and memory. However, in social animals that share food among group members, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), it is unknown whether group-level nutritional stress is manifested in the learning performance of individuals. Accordingly, we examined learning and memory in honey bee workers reared by colonies exposed to varying degrees of long-term pollen stress. Pollen provides honey bee workers with almost all of the proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals that they require as larvae and adults. Colonies were created that were either chronically pollen poor or pollen rich, or were intermediate in pollen supply; treatments altered colonies' pollen stores and brood-rearing capacity. Workers from these colonies were put through a series of olfactory-conditioning assays using proboscis-extension response (PER). PER thresholds were determined, then workers learned in olfactory-conditioning trials to associate two floral odors (one novel and the other presented previously without reward) with stimulation with sucrose and a sucrose reward. The strength of the memory that was formed for the odor/sucrose association was tested after olfactory-conditioning assays ended. Colony-level nutritional status had no effect on worker learning or memory (response threshold of workers to sucrose, acquisition of the odor/sucrose association, occurrence of latent inhibition, or memory retention over 72�h). We conclude that potential effects of chronic, colony-wide nutrient deprivation on learning and memory are not found in workers, probably because colonies use brood-rearing capacity to buffer nutrient stress at the level of the individual.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Object permanence in Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius) was investigated using a complete version of the Uzgiris and Hunt scale 1. Nine hand-raised jays were studied, divided into
two groups according to their different developmental stages (experiment 1, older jays: 2–3 months old, n = 4; experiment 2, younger jays: 15 days old, n = 5). In the first experiment, we investigated whether older jays could achieve piagetian stage 6 of object permanence. Tasks
were administered in a fixed sequence (1–15) according to the protocols used in other avian species. The aim of the second
experiment was to check whether testing very young jays before their development of “neophobia” could influence the achievement
times of piagetian stages. Furthermore, in this experiment tasks were administered randomly to investigate whether the jays’
achievement of stage 6 follows a fixed sequence related to the development of specific cognitive abilities. All jays tested
in experiments 1 and 2 fully achieved piagetian stage 6 and no “A not B” errors were observed. Performance on visible displacement
tasks was better than performance on invisible ones. The results of experiment 2 show that “neophobia” affected the response
of jays in terms of achievement times; the older jays in experiment 1 took longer to pass all the tasks when compared with
the younger, less neophobic, jays in experiment 2. With regard to the achieving order, jays followed a fixed sequence of acquisition
in experiment 2, even if tasks were administered randomly, with the exception of one subject. The results of these experiments
support the idea that piagetian stages of cognitive development exist in avian species and that they progress through relatively
fixed sequences.},

Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such 'personality differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.},

	abstract = {The current study investigated whether women show an attentional bias toward courtship language during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle. Thirty heterosexual women (17 naturally cycling, 13 using hormonal contraceptives) completed a dichotic listening task on both a high and low fertility day of their menstrual cycle. Participants were asked to verbally repeat (shadow) an emotionally neutral target passage played in one ear while either a neutral or courtship distracter was played in the other ear. Courtship distracters were flirtatious in content but not overtly sexual. Shadowing errors were coded as a measure of attentional bias toward the distracter. Saliva samples were taken to determine whether levels of estradiol, progesterone and/or testosterone correlated with task performance. As predicted, naturally cycling women made more shadowing errors when listening to a courtship distracter during the fertile phase of their cycle than during the nonfertile phase. This effect was moderated by relationship status, such that fertile, mated women showed an attentional bias for courtship language but fertile single women did not. However, because of small sample sizes in the analysis, this relationship should be viewed as preliminary. Hormonal analysis revealed that higher levels of salivary estradiol predicted greater attentional bias toward courtship language in naturally cycling women. These results suggest that women's attention is drawn to verbal courtship signals when they are fertile, and that this shift is linked to increased estradiol release during the periovulatory phase.},

However, there are examples that do not fit this pattern. We argue that these examples can be better understood by considering the phylogenetic relatedness between species. We reconstruct the ancestral state for caching behaviour in corvids and assess when transitions in caching behaviour occurred within the corvid phylogeny. Our analysis shows that the common ancestor of all corvids was a moderate cacher. This result suggests that corvids followed a bi-directional evolutionary trajectory in which caching was secondarily lost twice and there were at least two independent transitions from moderate to specialized caching. The independent evolution of specialized cachers in the two groups must, therefore, be a case of convergent evolution. This is exemplified by the fact that specialized cachers show structurally different adaptations serving the same function to intense caching, such as different pouches to transport food. Finally, we argue that convergent evolution may have led to adaptations in memory and hippocampus that serve the same function but differ in design, and that these different adaptations may explain the examples that do not fit the pattern predicted by the adaptive specialization hypothesis.},

They recovered a median of 65\% of them 2-3 hrs later, making only 2 errors/seed while doing so. Over trials, they used some sites more often than others, but during recovery they were more likely to visit a site of any preference value if they had stored a seed there that day than if they had not. Recovery performance was much worse if the experimenters moved the seeds between storage and recovery. A fixed search strategy that had some of the same average properties as the Ss' search behavior also did worse than the real birds. In Exp II, any tendency to visit the same sites on successive daily tests in the aviary was placed in opposition to memory for storage sites by allowing Ss to store more seeds 2 hrs after storing a 1st batch. They tended to avoid individual storage sites holding seeds from the 1st batch. When Ss searched for all the seeds 2 hrs later, they tended to recover more seeds from the 2nd than from the 1st batch, demonstrating a recency effect.

This difference may attribute to anatomical differences, hormonal influences and environmental factors such as stress. However, the higher prevalence in women normalizes once menopause is established, suggesting that ovarian hormones may play an important role in the development of depression in women. Ovarian hormones such as estrogen can pass the brain-blood barrier and bind to cytoplasmatic estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta in different areas of the limbic system. During stress, estrogen can modulate the behavioral and neurobiological response depending on the concentrations of estrogen. In this review we present evidence for disparate effects of chronic stress on neuroplasticity and brain activity in male and female rats. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that effects of social support on coping with stress can be mimicked by social housing of rats and that this model can be used for identification of underlying neurobiological mechanisms, including behavior, phosphorylation of CREB and ERK1/2, and brain activity changes as measured with fos expression. Using cyclic administration of estrogen in ovariectomized female rats we could specifically address effects of different plasma estrogen levels and antidepressants on stress-induced neuroplasticity and activity changes. In this model we also studied effects of estrogen on recovery after chronic stress. We conclude that the female brain has a different innate strategy to handle stress than the male brain and that female animal models are necessary for studying the underlying mechanisms and options for treatment.},

	abstract = {It is known from primates that alliance partners may support each other's interests in competition with others, for example, through repeated agonistic attacks against a particular individual. We examined serial aggressive interactions between greylag goose families and other flock members. We found that repeated attacks towards the same individual were common and that up to five serial attacks by family members followed an initial attack. Family size did not affect the frequency of such serial attacks. Juvenile geese evidently benefited most from active social support through serial attacks. About 60\% of the juveniles' lost primary interactions were subsequently reversed by another family member. This may be one of the reasons why juveniles rank higher in the social hierarchy than would be expected from their age and size alone. Losses in serial attacks predominantly occurred against other, presumably higher-ranking, family geese and ganders. We propose three major functions/consequences of serial attacks. Analogous to primates, serial attacks in greylag geese may serve to reinforce a losing experience of an opponent defeated in a preceding attack. On the side of the winning family, serial attacks may reinforce the experience of winning. Both winning and losing experiences are linked with physiological consequences in higher vertebrates, affecting the future social performance of winners or losers. Finally, serial attacks may signal the agonistic potential of a family to other flock members. This is supported by heart rate data, which indicate that greylags are competent to interpret third-party relationships.},
