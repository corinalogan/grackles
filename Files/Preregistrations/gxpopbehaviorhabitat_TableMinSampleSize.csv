Reversal,Phi (learning rate),Gamma,"Differences of 0.01 are likely to be detected (based on models with 20 individuals per site, however this is likely to hold for the the minimum sample size as well) (Figures SM2.1 and SM2.2",15
Reversal,Lambda (random choice rate),Gamma,"Differences of 3 are likely to be detected (based on models with 20 individuals per site, however this is likely to hold for the the minimum sample size as well) (Figures SM2.1 and SM2.2)",15
Multiaccess box,Number of loci solved,Binomial,Differences of 1.2 loci are likely to be detected (Table SM2),15
Exploration,Latency to approach novel object,Gamma-Poisson,Differences of at least 450 seconds are likely to be detected (Table SM2),15
Persistence,Percent of trials participated in,Normal,Difference of at least 0.08 in the proportion of trials participated in (Table SM2),18
