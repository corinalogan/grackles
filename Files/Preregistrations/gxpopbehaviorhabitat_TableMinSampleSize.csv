Reversal,Phi (learning rate),Normal,"Differences of 0.01 are likely to be detected (based on models with 20 individuals per site, however this is likely to hold for the the minimum sample size as well). See Figure X",15
Reversal,Lambda (random choice rate),Normal,"Differences of 3 are likely to be detected (based on models with 20 individuals per site, however this is likely to hold for the the minimum sample size as well). See Figure X",15
Multiaccess box,Number of loci solved,Binomial,"e.g. 1.4 vs 2.6 loci 
The difference has to be at least 30% of the maximum 4 loci",15
Exploration,Latency to approach novel object,Gamma-Poisson,"e.g. 450 vs 900 secs 
The difference has to be at least 17% of the maximum 2700 secs",15
Persistence,Percent of trials participated in,Normal,"e.g. 80% vs 88% 
The difference has to be at least 8% of the maximum 100%",18
